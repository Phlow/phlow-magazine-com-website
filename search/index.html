While reflecting society and its desire to show off in his Video-Series “Bootyclipse”, his website makes fun of all that Web 2.0-Dingeling. And till then, you haven’t heard his mind-twisting raps full of satirical rhymes. “Animal Audition” haunts you with its Funk, Samples and absorbing grooves.MP3 – Click to listenTracky Birthday - &quot;Balla!&quot; (MP3)Tracky Birthday - &quot;Overdosie Rosie&quot; (MP3)Tracky Birthday - &quot;Eöööhh!

Most of the time musicians only think about their music, compose good or bad songs and often forget about entertainment and other arts. On the contrary Tracky Birthday introduces you to music by letting you see the full scope.His raps won’t introduce you to the world of BlingBling-Diamond-Shit. Neither they’ll throw some trash on you of his ghetto-childhood. No, in his raps and music Tracky Birthday reflects our society in the digital age. It’s an album filled with music history. An album which mashes up sound of our computer-childhood with pop-anthems from Michael Jackson.And on top you listen to fast raps, playing with the english language like a true digital native. Rub your ears for this incredible german rapper, born into a global world where we all live in.Meet Tracky Birthday where the Wu meets the Bat…BootyclipseTracky Birthday aka Dennis Knopf won a Prize for Online Art at the 22nd Filmwinter Festival 2009 for his Bootyclipse Video Series. Watch this video and enjoy!  In the summer of 2007, a German rapper and a debutant net artist Dennis Knopf opened a channel on YouTube that he named Bootyclipse. Every video broadcasted on that channel consists of those candid moments, prolonged to 40-60 seconds. Dennis has collected fragments from more than twenty videos where a girl who is going to shake her booty in front of a camera has not appeared in the frame yet, and looped these moments, leaving the music to play in real time.

Superloader - “Let if off!” (MP3)  Superloader - “Fusion” (MP3)  Superloader - “Wig Wam Bam” (MP3)Superloader makes that sort of house music which seems to never stop. If you’re not down in the club with the crew, you feel the lax mood. The night is long and Supafeed sucks us into that endless groove we get hypnotized by the whole night. Just take “Let it off”. You start the track and the groove is there. It will still be the same, when the track stops.

            "content": "Bitbasic’s new album Sprinkling Rainbows, released on Monotonik, delves deep into the world of smooth and funky Jazz stylings, in a follow up the 2007 “Grating Rainbows EP”. This is an album of deft and clever combinations that soothe and then surprise the listener, as exquisite jazz chords and chromatics give way to drill and bass rasps and glitchy repetition, before falling luxuriously back into a pleasing bath of strings or mellow guitar. Bitbasic presents music that plays on the tensions between heavily quantized, truncated sound and free style playing; indulging in a playground of cut ups and programming.MP3 – Click to listenRealizationDamaged Beyond RepairAint No SunshineAt over fifty minutes, this wonderfully cohesive album treats the listener to a variety of gear shifts and mood changes that make the whole experience engaging and enervating from beginning to end. Whether it is the rapid, funky breaks and signature changes of “Realization”, the acoustic guitar sound, descending Resident style analogue synth sighs and stuttering, reverby drums of “Damaged Beyond Repair”, or the surprising but beautifully executed cover of “Ain’t No Sunshine”, this is an album that will make you grin at the pleasure of it all.At some point during Roxy and Elsewhere, Frank Zappa declares that “Jazz isn’t dead, it just smells funny”: a statement that adroitly encapsulated the moribund state of much of what jazz had become by the mid 1970’s. For Zappa, a playful and creative engagement with jazz, and his combinations thereof with other musical styles, served as a platform for countless reinventions. While George Duke, Ruth Underwood, Don Preston, Napolean Murphy Brock et al may have been superseded by samples, perhaps, in some tenuous way, Bitbasic’s Sprinkling Rainbows is another step along a path of enlightened, intelligent and wry experimentation.Review written by Greg Healey.",

Music that makes us grin and nod happily.AEED “Cry Now”AEED “Elektricity”“Synesthesia” is colourful like the album cover itself. Listen to that pop appeal in “Cry now”. AEED rolls out the bass as a pumping fundament and than gets lost in melodies. This album has nothing to do with loop-orientated Hip Hop instrumentals. AEED feds his music with sweeping synths, funky or jazzy melodies which seem to glide easily from the keyboard into the corners of his broken beats.Sometimes “Synesthesia” is full of melancholy like in “Strange Dreams”. Sometimes AEED delivers us funky anthems like “Elephants Dance” bouncing on a sparkeling bassline. If you like electronica, chip music and if you have some b-boy-blood in your venes. This is the exact soundtrack. Error Broadcast gets bigger with each new release.

After his great debut called “Fireworks” the label refined his tracks with five excellent remixes.The sound of Grillo is pure, very digital and funky. On “Fireworks” we listen to crispy beats, clicks, snares and solid kicks. Most of the tracks are build on some melodic grooves. This made me rewind the album to listen again to slow movers like “Clicks” or the fantastic hit “Be aware”.Now we get the remixes and what can I say? I like the reworks even a little bit more. Each producer kept the digital sound of Grillo but managed to throw some of his delicate herbs and skills into the bowl. Just listen to the remix of “Be Aware” of Costa. Filled with some humour we nod to a straight-into-your-face pop hook. My favorite right now is the jazzy and funky retouch of Fulgeance on “Brown Box”.

But this classy DubTechno album by Marko Fürstenberg has to be promoted also here on Phlow-Magazine.com because it is still one the best DubTechno albums ever and one of the first netaudio longplayer which grabbed my attention from beginning to end.“Gesamtlaufzeit” is so amazing because you travel together with the artist from music gig to music gig. For his album Marko Fürstenberg composed smooth rockin DubTechno-tracks along with calm ambientish songs. Some of the songs where produced while travelling through Germany. If you imagine how the musician sits in the train, looks out the window and sees all the trees, houses, landscapes flying by, the sound fits perfect.

An incident like that happened to one of our creative commons music stars: Entertainment For The Braindead. She discovered the banjo. A unique instrument associated with music styles like Dixieland Jazz or Blues. But does the banjo also sounds in the hands of an artist dedicated to soft, fragile folk songs? Yes it does! Just listen!Entertainment For The Braindead- “Dry Wood” (MP3)Entertainment For The Braindead - “Pirates” (MP3)Entertainment For The Braindead - “Roadkill” (MP3)Julia Kotowski aka Entertainment For The Braindead got bonded by the strings of her banjo. She discovered sweet moments, beautiful melodies and that slight sad mood what shines through all her songs. We are happy to get the chance to listen to them. Just dive into her world and get carried away. I won’t say no more, just listen, enjoy and get your own hand-crafted record at her website.

His “Unbounding The Future EP” is an epic trip with haunting sounds, elaborate chopped-up beats and a unique style which makes every former master proud. You rarely find so deep, complex and intelligent Drum’n’Bass beats.N-Noiz - “Red Spider Nebula” (MP3)N-Noiz - “Hasaki” (MP3)N-Noiz - “Engines of Abundance” (MP3)N-Noiz - “Vibin The Crook” (MP3)This is one fantastic peace of drum’n’bass art. It’s dark, yes. There are no melodic hooks, yes. But if you are a beat addict as I am, you just have to admire the craftful work. You will be sucked into the deep atmosphere.With enthusiastic love N-Noiz formed outstanding drum’n’bass-tracks. And also if Photek is the sword-swinging leader, N-Noiz has his own fighting style. Just listen how the bass diggs a grave for every opponent, how the beats travel through the stereo field. My only critisism concerns to the last track “Vibin The Crook”. There N-Noiz repeated the vocals to much or the MC had no more rhymes in his pocket. Nevertheless the voice by Semtex M fits perfect to the music vibe.Dark, powerful and fresh!MP3 Drum and Bass Music DownloadDownload: N-Noiz - “Unbounding The Future EP” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: N-NoizRelease: N-Noiz - “Unbounding The Future EP”Netlabel: www.plainaudio.com",

We loved his pop anthem “Possibilities” so much, we had to include it on our free music compilation “Music From All Around The World”. And just some seconds later, he releases a new wonderful small album on Swedens brightest netlabel: 23 Seconds. Hurray!Rich And Timeless (MP3)Pinpointing The Problem (MP3)The Little Things (MP3)Magnet In My Mouth (MP3)We Own This Thing (MP3)Henrik José is also known for his moniker Bliss. And we music geeks know: Henrik José is no stranger to the world of free music. But while he explored IDM and Electronica under the cover of Bliss, he opens up under his real name. And during this process everything seems to fall into place.All the wonderful melodies he composed already years ago now meet the world of pop. If you listen closely to his five songs you also discover the tricks and twists in his games with beats. Here’s someone who grew up, but who doesn’t neglets his past. Here’s someone who won’t forget his love for Electronica and IDM. The only thing that changed, is that everything in the name of pop got a little bit more forward. Instead of shreddering beats up, we listen to the true voice, a voice that wants to tell us some stories.This is pure electrifying electronic pop without citation of the 80ies. No, it’s pop plus electronic music on an individual level.

Ever since I got to know him, Sven Swift releases music, makes music, makes tapes, makes something experimental as long as it has to do with music. While we wrote reviews on a high output level from 2007 to the beginning of 2010 for Phlow-Magazine.com, we now take it slow - the family has grown.          Currently Sven Swift focuses totally on his second netlabel - after 12rec.net - called Error Broadcast. And this is also what these charts are about. They are about electronic, abstract, bass-heavy and HipHop-inspired music. I call it Sven Swift's Best Free Music Moments 2010 because not all tracks were released under creative commons licence but the musicians uploaded them to the web to spread the music. So go to the websites and download these anthems and enjoy!

In 2007 I had participated in the project with several mixes and I started a blog in relation to netaudio. It wasn't long till I started my own netlabel. It's still very exciting to collaborate with people around the globe. I like it because there are no hierarchies, no need of authority.

Some of the best netlabels have reappeared as copyright pay-per-download sites. There's also a great amount of free-to-download music but not right-free out there, and copyright netlabels which generate confusion. However netaudio has overgone the 'great world crisis' and new netlabels sprout day after day. This year's best aspects are the great quality and quantity alternative netaudio resources, specially Ayoze García's Intangible23, the russian portal Techno-Locator,new blogs as Disruptive Platypus ans Musica Selection and the compilation shared by New TechnoID, Free Music 4All and Phlow.es itself.

And this release here got a certain quality, especially with the vocals. The charismatic MC sings about Africa, peace, god, faith and love. The sound of the music is clean and charming, a little bit rusty, warm and also a bit of French niceness shines through here and there. All that makes a classical dub-record. Play it in lounges and you will make friends. I promise!This release contains also a remix, much more blurred and stateless than the dub orientated tracks. What I would love to have is a pure instrumental version of the track “What can I do for Africa”. It plays in the same league like “The Modernist”, “Rockers Hi-Fi” and deep soundsystem stuff.

Fisher lives in beautyful Portland, is 50% of Unrecognizable Now and 100% of map~map. Very much what “blogs” used to be in the heyday of the interweb, “Dust Breeding” is about  posting something every day, typically photos and a few personal words. You can find spontaneous recordings, sound experiments and jam sessions there posted, too. This is entertaining at least, inspiring and memorable at best.“For Friends This Winter” was posted the 23. of December 2009. Six little compositions that engage you with subtle drones and cyclic motives of something that once was melody. The mood is dark chesnut with a hint of cosy russet. A wonderful and peaceful collection that goes perfectly well with Geotic or Maps and Diagrams, to name just my most recent posts in the Ambient-genre. Love.",

Typically this is not necessary as every releases speaks for itself, and this is especially true when you consider Montags’ “Des Cassettes et un Walkman Jaune”.Montag is Vancouver-based Antoine Bédard. On this little EP, the man reworks adolescence favourites in his very own styles of warm synth arrangements, leftfield singing and Disco beats. We get to hear popular songs by PM Dawn, Bronski Beat and Eurythmics as well as a Breeders, Unrest and Low cover.Interestingly, the 90s songs and the 80s songs go together very well. This is mainly because Antoine makes the tender Indierock of the likes named atop sound 80s whilst leaving his Synthpop idols rather untouched. One might criticize this as too soft and artless. Myself I enjoy the lush and nostalgic melodies and meanwhile consider the possibility to purchase his latest album “Going Places”.MP3 POP Music DownloadDownload: “Des Cassettes et un Walkman Jaune” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: http://montag.caRelease: http://peppermillrecords.com/pm015Netlabel: http://peppermillrecords.com",

            "content": "Tribute to Pop // The album Numbskull by Lord Lumb is an unashamed celebration by an artist of his heroes. With name checks going to David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Debbie Harry, his Lordship lays his cards of inspiration on the table within the first few lines of the opening track “I Dream Of Bowie”. This excellent piece of bouncing electronic pop rock, the result I am told of a dream about David Bowie, sets the scene for an album that is crammed with refreshing songs whose origins in the electronic music of the late 1970s is clear. Lord Numb - “Eileen” (MP3)Lord Numb - “I Dream of Bowie” (MP3)And Lord Numb certainly knows how to write songs. “A Man With A ? For A Face” skips along with Lord Numb’s trade mark combination of edgy live guitar and monophonic analogue synth sounds, driven by an urgent and mechanized drum beat.However, this is certainly no exercise in Heritage Electronica. The gritty “Cubitt”, with its classic synth sounds and flat distorted guitars, is a good example of a track where Lord Numb makes good use of momentary glitches and contemporary production values to ensure that this is definitely an album for the Twenty First Century.The floating and resonant “Never Going Home” brings down the tempo, mining similar territory to David Bowie’s Space Oddity, with it’s references to being lost in space far away from home.This is an album both dark and humorous, that contains surprising juxtapositions of the familiar and the strange. The natural, often represented by the human voice and the guitar, is deployed as a taught counterpoint to electronic and machine sounds. Lord Numb’s undoubted talent as a songsmith provides an able frame work upon which lie layers and layers of intoxicating sound.Like his hero, David Bowie, who at the height of his powers could mould an unfamiliar shape into catchy tune and, conversely, mutate a catchy tune into an unfamiliar shape, Numb is a master of the hook and the contorted sound. In this album he builds on his earlier material, like “Pipistrelle”, to produce a sound that, while referencing his heroes such as Bowie, Devo, Magazine and Neu (to name but a few), is distinctly Lord Numb.What I love most about this album is its clarity of purpose, its concise approach to music making. There are no drifting, meandering, self indulgent tracks lasting 10 minutes or more, so often the curse of modern electronic music. There is no waste or waffle. The longest track tops out at a neat four minutes and seven seconds. This is a gem of an album.MP3 Pop Music DownloadDownload: Lord Numb - “Numbskull” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: www.myspace.com/lordynumbRelease: Lord Numb - “Numbskull”Netlabel: www.svcrecords.co.uk",

For me, richness, atmosphere and innovative sound design is important. While “The Giant Woods” could have been transmitted in the early 70’s (soundwise), the dense and slightly haunting feel of the record got me eventually. The artwork caught that impression very well - a walk through the forest at night, getting lost in a foreign town as the sun is about to settle… The chill comes on soft feet!Besides, the intense layering and enwinding of different textures creates a sound that allows for aural discoveries on every new listen.

German songwriterGillicuddy combines the most different genres on a short-lived EP, typically in one song. This has been true for “Shmalhans is Kuechenmeister” and “The Repeating Thoughts” but is brought to perfection only now.Take “de mannetjesolifant gaat op reis naar de oostzee” as an example. First part is technical Noiserock, Jesus Lizard-style. Then Gillicuddy slows down the Jazz and pushes the song in a direction reminiscent of Sonic Youth: slightly detuned guitars, decent but uneal somehow. These fade into multilayer field-recordings you are never allowed to trust. Eventually, the secret is revealed, and the elephants of the Baltic Sea make their appearance…This song is the wildest. However, despite the versatility, a typical atmosphere of humorous darkness comes with all songs on “The Yaouhl! Mashups”. This brings forth consistency, proofs the musical craftsmanship of Gillicudy and guarantees for great listening pleasure. His best up to now, without the slightest doubt.MP3 Avantgarde Pop Music DownloadDownload: “The Yaouhl! Mashups” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: www.gillicuddy.netRelease: Gillicuddy - “The Yaouhl!

That’s why I adore so much the releases of Budabeats. Crookram was the second artist who refined the catalogue. Now he starts his own netlabel Bankrupt Recordings.While “19/76” was epic, “The Escape EP” is pure and a great production featuring different MCs - I guess from the Netherlands. Tracks like “Patterns of Thought (ft. Wreckitnize)” were produced to walk through the city in the sunshine and get a little melancholic. What amuses me, is that I like the instrumental called “Epilogue” the best. Maybe this is the track which glues his old album on Budabeats together with his next step. Even if the whole production is skillful, I wish sometimes more edges, some little gimmicks. To me Crookram is best, when he gets melancholic and hopefully he will write for us another epilogue soon.PS: The onyl sad thing about this EP is… I would love to hear some real Dutch rap ;)MP3 Music DownloadDownload: Sagesse &amp; Crookram - “The Escape EP” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: Sagesse and CrookramRelease: Sagesse &amp; Crookram - “The Escape EP”Netlabel: Bankrupt Recordings",

Well, it was only due to his son’s persistence that the tracks saw daylight.Please make notice to the fact that you’re not listening to music only, you’re listening to the stories that were left behind on Alentejo’s plain (South of Portugal). Most of the songs names are real places names. And those that are not still have something important to remind us. For instance, “Tributo” is as tribute to a soldier who died during the portuguese colonial war back in the 60’s. Alexandre Bateiras was there, whitnessed the moment and was able to show us what happened with a few chords.This is instumental portuguese folk: real stories told and played with a portuguese guitar. Stories of a man and somehow of an old generation of people who lived in a quiet rural Portugal and stopped their adolescense to be part of a war.Regardless the history lesson, these melodies are something that anyone hardly forgets.

These six tracks come off like a collection of songs rather than an EP so I reckon we get outtakes to hear - however, this does not diminish quality in any way.Bluermutt - “The Broken City” (MP3)Bluermutt - “Androids’ Breath” (MP3)Bluermutt - “Indoor Failure” (MP3)Bluermutt - “Single Touch” (MP3)Bluermutt’s “Dislocation (and Consequences)” EP oscillates between highly processed Folk, Krautrock and melodic Electronica. Strength to his compositions is always the strong melodies, governed by a warm and rich production. Maybe this is why I consider Bluermutt Pop music rather than anything else- albeit, Pop music with respectable edges.The first four tracks are breathtaking: “The Broken City” sounds like a dedusted Harmonia jam, ca. 1974, so full of melancholy sweetness and glittering textures. “Android’s Breath” features Leafcutter John, soul alike when it comes to “Fractal Folk”. His mature yet gentle voice fits the Bluermutt sound neatlessly. Wow. “Indoor Failure” eventually is pure candy. Over a Four Tet-style instrumental, vocals and guitar perform a wonderful Pop melody. Ohrwurm, you were warned! On four, “Single Touch” introduces the ambient part of “The Dislocation (and Consequences)”. Warm and cracking Dub, bathed in sunlit harmonies, and a lot of depth: just wonderful.Support Bluermutt by sending over some bucks for the download! “The Dislocation (and Consequences)” EP is available for pay-as-you-like via bandcamp.MP3 Electronic Pop Music DownloadArtist-Website: skyapnea.comRelease: Bluermutt - The Disloaction (and Consequences) EP****",

Stockfinster, all the same, is a name commonly known to fans of free music. After the debut “All Becomes Music” was released in 2005, it took four years to complete “Dead Line”, the novel full-lenght of album of Stockfinster.

In the liner notes to “Dead Line”, Borg (who commonly appears as “batti”) excuses himself for being unproductive and slow. However, for a 76 minutes opus magnus, perfectly arranged and composed like this, many musicians need a whole lifetime for. If any.The music of Stockfinster is a mixture of Postrock and progressive Pop, essentially enhanced by many electronic elements. There is an element of nostalgia to Borg’s music that stems from his melancholic melodies and the late 90’s breakbeat patterns. Several time I had to think of early Lamb or other forward-thinking “Trip Hop” acts. From the world of Netaudio, Orange Crush, Endless or Nic Bommaritio might suit for comparison.Albeit not actually at the edge of contemporary music, Stockfinster has something more valuable to offer: timelessness.

            "content": "After years of working as an music journalist I am still surprised how the print music media ignore the world of free music. Creative Commons Musicians nearly get no support by print magazines which write about music. Netlabels get no spot, even if they try. The only print media which cover creative commons topics are newspapers and live style magazines. Only one exception proves the rule: A German magazine called Beat writing about synthesizers, music production and… yes, Creative Commons Music. We interviewed its driving force aka main editor aka Thomas Raukamp.Thomas, please introduce yourself! How did you get main editor of Beat and where are your roots?First of all, let me thank you for the privilege of being interviewed by one of my favorite online magazines out there. Phlow has been a big inspiration for me over the last couple of years and you’re doing a fantastic job.I came to journalism through my enthusiam for Atari computers back in the 1990s, which lead me to writing for “st-computer”, the last remaining print magazine in the German Atari market at that time. As you can imagine, I used the Atari for making music, as it was the no. 1 music machine back then. So I always had a passion for music and especially all kinds of electronic styles. To make a long story short, I always tried to combine my interests for technology and music, which prepared me for music journalism in the field of electronic music, I guess.When was your first contact to free music and creative commons music in general?My first contact with free music was back in the days when members of the Amiga and Atari demo scene exchanged the music they generated with trackers on their machines via mailboxes, forums and early versions of the web. Later the original MP3.com was the first online service that made me realize the potential of the net to distribute free music without the creative limitations of the mainstream music industry, which I learned to hate more with every passing year.Granted, a lot of stuff that was released on MP3.com back then could cause severe earache compared to today’s standards of recording, but it was that unbiased approach to write, produce and distribute your own music, that made those early music communities so charming - looking back it was kind of anarchic. On the other hand, I still follow amazing bands I firstly discovered on MP3.com, like the amazing Electrostatic. Must have been around 2004/2005 when I stumbled upon the first netlabel I discovered, and it was the fantastic iD.EOLOGY, which I still admire.With its first issue in 2005 Beat introduced surprisingly Brigitte Bijoux as MP3 Music Artist of the month. Since then you kept an eye on free music on the web and increased your energy to cover the creative commons scene. Why?In my opinion you’ll find the most relevant music that is produced today in the netaudio or netlabel scene, just because it is not driven by commercial interests and is amazingly close to the bone. This may sound quite romantic and even odd to some, but for the vast majority of netlabels, it still is the case and will forever be. The netaudio scene has already changed the process of distributing your own music - and it has the power to continue to do that.Computers, tools like Ableton Live and VST-Plug-ins have emancipated nowadays’ musicians from expensive recording studios and time with producers, and the netaudio scene is just the next logical step, as it emancipates them from the traditional kinds of distribution via record companies and their creative restraints. Combine that with the power of the web to distribute trends faster than any other medium out there, and you’ll have the most authentic look at today’s music. How could we as magazine, which claims to stay close to the musical pulse as well as to the people out there who actually produce music here and now, ignore that?Why do you think ignore music print media the world free music and musicians? Is it only because netlabels don’t advertise in print magazines or is there maybe another reason?It would be too blue-eyed, if I said that wouldn’t be part of the problem, right? But on the other hand, most of the ambitious music magazines out there also cover releases from independent record labels that don’t have the money to advertise as well - just because at least the labels that take their job seriously send out demos and cds.This is still a significant problem in the netlabel scene to be honest - most people who run a netlabel forget that their work should start right there where the average netlabel head thinks it stops, they forget to promote their artists’ work. Putting a release on a webseite and getting out some notes about it within the scene’s blogs and forums or on Twitter and Facebook should just be the beginning of getting the word out.If you want coverage in relevant magazines, print or online, you should at least send them an email or even better an email and a cd with some nice artwork they’ll remember so you have to do the first step. Or give them a call to tell them you just released some excellent music on your label they should listen to. To a journalist, it won’t matter if you are a traditional label or a netlabel, they just care about the quality of the music you put out. If they find out that it is yet free, they’ll love it even more. Plus, netlabels should organize events and release parties on which they showcase their acts, or they should even organize and promote tours with them. Music journalists still happen to run into concerts and parties ;)I should add there are already some netlabels out there which do a great job in promoting their artists, like the wonderful aaahh-records. And they’re very successful: “Entertainment For The Braindead” didn’t just go down like a storm within the scene, it also received some attention by regular media. Same with rec72 and Zoe.Leela’s “Queendom Come”.To be fair, I must admit it is certainly also music journalism’s own fault to ignore a scene that keeps some of the most precious gems of today’s music scene. Journalists tend to be lazy, and they would have to dig a little deeper than they’re used to in order to find them.Nowadays musicians - especially electronic musicians - get lots of incredible music software for free. Next to freeware vst plugins you also find user-friendly music software on mobile phones like a lot of incredible apps for the iphone for example. Do you think free music software could endanger some day in the near future magazines like Beat, because all the tools you need wait to be downloaded for free? Could it be possible that something similiar might happen to print magazines dealing with music software and music devices like the death of the old music industry? What happens if suddenly mobil phones morph into music machines and so on?You’ll never know ;) In my personal opinion a print magazine has to return to what it does best: delivering in-depth information. So coverage in a print magazine has to be vertical, not horizontal. And the worst idea to me is to try to imitate online magazines in a print magazine or compete with them in their ancestral strongholds.A print magazine is a print magazine is a print magazine, right? And this is what people expect from it. They already pick up the latest news and tools from the internet, they don’t need a print magazine to do that for them. A print magazine does a good job, if people love to take it with them to their favorite armchair or to bed and actually read in it and say “I didn’t know that before” when they finished an article of their interest. There still is an sincere interest in in-depth information, and the web still isn’t the right ambience for that - which might change in the near future with new tools and technical gizmos by companies like Apple and their new tablet whatever. So I guess we’ll have to answer these questions again in two years time or so.Please tell us your Top-5 Creative Commons Songs, Top-5 Creative Commons music album and Top-5 netlabels you won’t miss anymore.This is a tough one, I keep asking that myself every day. ;) So here are my Top 5 netlabels for this day in no particular order:  Aquietbump   Escala  Archipel  SEM/IOD   The Peppermill  CorpidIt’s even tougher to name my favorite CC-albums, there’s so much wonderful stuff out there - so this is also a mere snapshot:  Sky Barstow - “It’s Circular” (Phlow Review)  Adamned.Age - “Tard Dans La Nuit”  Fjordne - “Light Passed On Through The Layer”  Black Era - “Third Eye Guerilla” (Phlow Review)  Erdbeerschnitzel - “Vorsprung durch Hektik”  Rupert Falsch - “Links auf der Fahrbahn, ein totes Tier”It’s impossible for me to name my favorite CC-songs, I think I tend towards being an album lover.

Not that I like that everything should be cute, please, no way! But I think it is an interesting approach on music and a clever way to focus on a certain style of music without closing the door to different music styles. Like they say on their website  Because this is not about doing one style or an other style…  This is not about this instrument or that one…  Neither about sounding the most experimental, hell no.

With his heart pounding for melodies and HipHop Beats his free album “Waxxelerated” hit me years ago. The melodic album with hiphop instrumentals was produced with one of those programs called trackers. No doubt you hear on this album how loop-driven most these old tracker productions were. But what counts is the groove, and on “Waxxelerated” you get plenty of it.Willbe - “Cruise the World” (MP3)Yeah, Willbe remastered his ten-years-old netaudio-masterpiece. And yeah, it still sounds more LoFi than HiFi. But nevertheless I love the vibe and “Cruise the World” is next to “Zephyr” still my favorite Willbe track.So give this classic a listen. Enjoy how Willbe mixed all the tracks slightly together for an unique listening experience. Expect straight forward running breabeats, exotic samples and melodic grooves.

And when I listen now to the two beautiful “NetAudio Russia Compilations” I am once more convinced that Russia especially Moscow has a strong eletronic scene I would like to explore by night. Both compilations are compiled with care and are just great.Iky Que - “10msec” (MP3)Frunk29 - “Alenkin Home” (MP3)Feldmaus - “Put On A Magical Hood (Passage Version)” (MP3)Vadim Lankov - “Impudence” (MP3)&lt;img class=”alignleft size-medium wp-image-1392” title=”netaudio_russia_compilation_2” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/netaudio_russia_compilation_2.jpg”On both “NetAudio Russia Compilations” you find in general three music genres: breakbeat-driven tracks, melodic techno and ambient tunes.At first I thought, the compilators would have separated four to the floor-tracks from IDM from Ambient, but that’s not the case.The main idea of both compilations is to let the listeners explore the variety of electronic music done by musicians performing on the festival. And I have to say, both trips are just wonderful and fit well together.You dive into dreamish IDM like “Rosolam (Novomix)” from moroza_knozova or breakbeats with vocals like “10msec” from Iky Que or more straight elektro like “Liquid Fur” from Stud.On the more upfront side I adore especially two tracks which would best be described as poetic minimal techhouse. Give “Put On A Magical Hood (Passage Version)” by Feldmaus and “Alenkin Home” by Frunk29 a listen. Wonderful tunes, to dance in the morning hours to with your eyes shut of course. Truly extraordinay how Frunk29 weaves some jazzy flavor into his track.But also DJs with a heart for more pushy grooves get something for their sets. Vadim Lankov knows how to give the bassdrum that adequate kick. He hands us two excellent tracks over. With “Lankov - secondsun” he explores minimal techno with some tricky shuffling and experimental sounds and “Impudence” is that rave tune, you need to heat up the dancefloor.A really fantastic double-feature from Russia.

Especially the piano song called “Face” with its video left an impression on me. The moody piano chords match excellent together with the captured happy moments with friends.While watching this video I thought: “Where is this place?!? I want to go there, too!” Also in this video music and images fit perfectly together and give us small glimpse into a happening where people met, shared creative moments together and had an exceptional time.

            "content": "      Happy netaudio decade // It has been 10 years since I discovered netlabels. While scrobbling my hard drives I found some 1999 MP3 files! That was last century, right?!?. What could have been considered as a crazy/shocking new marketing idea - that is: giving (ocassionally good) music for free - is now a common strategy in any music related enterprise.          While some consider a constant decrease of the differences between netlabels and conventional/traditional/former labels - an idea I totally support - I can still evidence what has always been my personal difference criteria amongst both worlds: creativity. It's not just about high quality music but about the knowledge generated within its community, about sharing and developing services, tools and ideas. Being a teacher myself makes this last sentence so important. After the words, the tunes. On quite a hurry, I've chosen some of my 2009 top spots, happy to share them with you. Merry xmas!

            "content": "      I'm honored to take part in Phlow's year-end list-making tradition - it's a very cool and important project for the future of netaudio culture. As 2009 comes to a close, we have more free music at our fingertips than ever before, which is mostly good but it also means it's still easy for good music to get lost in the shuffle. Thankfully there are some amazingly attuned digi-crate diggers out there - like the Phlow Magazine team - who are determined to uncover every single mp3 gemstone the world wide web has to offer.          WFMU 91.1-FM founded the Free Music Archive with a similar curatorial mission - to extend radio's promise of \"free public access to curated audio\" into the digital era. Since our beta-launch in April, the Free Music Archive has become a platform for esteemed curators of all stripes - not just radio stations but also venues, festivals, magazines, museums, arts organizations, historical projects, and some of the world's finest positive curatorial forces in netaudio (shout-outs to Phlow, BlocSonic, Creative Commons, Weirdo Music / WM Recordings, Cash Music, Free Albums Galore, Oddio Overplay). In less than a year, the FMA library has tripled in size to include nearly 15,000 songs. And - as our homepage says - \"it's not just free music; it's good music\".          In other words, it was extremely difficult to pick just five highlights out of so many thousands! In fact, if you'd've asked me this morning, or after I had a chance to dig through all the other fantastic recommendations in this series, I probably would've had a completely different list. Anyway, here are just a few of the many things that I personally loved this year, not representative of the tastes of the FMA as a whole, but if you want thousands more check out freemusicarchive.org or follow Free Music Archive Twitter.

But this galaxy was far too large to be condensed as only netlabels records: soon it became a small window to an endless universe.

Put down AEED, B-Ju and Comfort Fit for the watchlist. Accordingly, I’ve been listening to a ridiculous amount of free beat music. Some of these I’d like to share with you. See my top five albums and songs please.          12rec. is doing slow but well nevertheless. We saw Bernier &amp; Trottier and Nic Bommarito return with wonderful releases.

            "content": "      Time is flying, but 2009 was a good year in Creative Commons music - opposed to the music-lobbying from the global major labels. 2009 was also an interesting year from the political point of view - where I had lots of discussions, not only with music-activists, netculture-lovers, but also with people who formed the still new Pirate party here in Germany. For me CC-music was always a little bit more, than just putting plain mp3s into the internet. And maybe there are new opportunities coming up. The best is yet to come - the web is still a young fellow.          My activities 2009 did not only include talking, thinking and writing, but also manifested in real-life activities. I did co-organize the Cologne Commmons Festival and are running the site Netaudio-NRW - a site for Creative Commons Events in the area of North Rhine-Westfalia (NRW) area. I still wait for other people, doing a similar project in other parts of federal states of Germany - or also in other countries. Let's build a network!

It keeps burbling along so as to thank CC artists for their efforts and to publicise the Creative Commons movement. CTW has made an appointment with its psychiatrist to discuss its recently developed habit of talking about itself in the third person.\"          Photo: \"Resting Place\" by jmacphoto.com &lt;/div&gt;                                   Top-5 Songs 2009                          The Lights Galaxia - \"While She Sleeps (Morning Edit)\"                          Halogen - \"Length and Brecht (Synaecide Remix)\"                          Erdbeerschnitzel - \"Walkampfchampagne\"                          Blue Swerver - \"Untempo\"                          Keinzweiter - \"Mircoobee\"                                Top Netlabels 2009                                    Unfoundsound                          rec72                          IDMf                          inoQuo                          Test Tube                                        Best Creative Commons Albums 2009                                    Erdbeerschnitzel - Pathetik Party                          Halogen - Length and Brecht (Remixed)                          Robin Grey - Only The Missile                          Josh Woodward - Crawford Street                          Sean Fournier - Oh My                              ",

This means something positive: we have more and more nice free music to listen and to review!&lt;/p&gt;               Personally, this year I've had the chance to meet a lot of people from the netaudio scene on the Netaudio Festival in Berlin and during the last months, we're working on a redesign of the netaudio.es platform and objectives, just as helping the launch of phlow.es.                  I've selected a collection of peacefully songs and netlabels from electronic pop to idm, passing by some beats and good atmospheres. I hope you enjoyed them!\"&lt;/em&gt;                  David Domingo/netaudio.es                  David Domingo has been an engineer, musician, dj, producer, visual artist, activist and event organizer in the last years, always mixing art and music with technology - his two passions.

What I like about the Jambassa sound is the curiosity and intelligence with which Carmine Minichiello and Raffaele Gargiulo build their rhythm-driven riddims.On top seven different artists chant and sing over the grooves from Italy. That makes this album unique and entertaining. Just listen to “like silence” featuring Ltd. Candy and compare it to “combo combo thing” featuring Reddog and Boom Buzz. While Ltd.

            "content": "Punching Pac-Man through a Space EchoNiches can be cool. Especially when you’re the star of one. Even better when you dug it out from nothing all by yourself. Jan Gleichmar, aka Disrupt, label head of Jahtari.org, is the star of his own genre. He refines a bulky sub-bass sound with an oldschool 8-bit charm. He calls it simply: Digital Laptop Reggae.Being a nerd can also be cool. Especially if you manage to produce something as catchy as what Disrupt came up with. His first netlabel release came out in May 2004 on the electronica label Phonocake.org from Dresden, Germany. It was melodious, hard to get out of your head and surprisingly successful. A separate netlabel platform was needed — a project Jan quickly baptized Jahtari.Know your rootsThe success and ease of these recordings lies in the clever but simple recipe that’s at the heart of most of Disrupt’s music.  Take the bass riff from something rockin’ tune or,…  Compose your own riddim.  Melt together with a melody from the 8-bit generation. (Monkey Island coconut flavor or something from the pantry in the Maniac Mansion)Wanna taste? Check out “International Karate” (“IT+ Version”).At the age of 31 Jan has already experienced a big chunk of music culture. Travelling through gabba and drum-and-bass; over experimental to minimal techno he arrived at the happy island we call dub. On this journey he was influenced by more than classics loved in Jamaica. Inspiration came to him via the Berlin Basic Channel posse, Moritz von Oswaldt and Mark Ernestus, all of whom were a part of the Rhythm &amp; Sound project.As Disrupt it was never Jan’s intention to just fall into old catagories. He wanted to find a way to let his beloved dub reggae develop. That’s how the Digital Laptop Reggae concept was born. Because after all, at the bottom of it there’s a singing notebook CPU and the music software Ableton Live. For the charming 8-bit feel of his trademark sound he threw in an extra bunch of rusty freeware plug-ins.To all this, Jan combined the idea of the riddim. A riddim is like the musical open source code of dub. A hook line, if you will. It’s basically a short bass instrumental. Riddims have an original source but are used again and again by diverse artists to make new songs. Often enough riddims have been used and changed and mutated so much that the source or even the original composer can no longer be identified. It’s generally the rule that a riddim is not simply copied and used. As in hip hop and drum-and-bass, where a classic drum loop is rearranged into a new beat, Disrupt takes a riddim and after slicing and dicing, adds it to his own recipe. If he can’t find a riddim that fits, he simply cooks up his own.Sound signatureThere’s a certain nostalgia listening to the sound of Disrupt — be it at Phonocake.org, iDEOLOGY.de or right there at Jahtari.org. The idea of recompiling retro-esque C64 game soundtracks is as simple as it is clever. For Jan it is more than a fondness for computer nostalgia though. It’s a deep musical appreciation of the composers of the 8-bit era, as their timeless songs have their very own sound and composition aesthetic. Jan rolls them up in massive bass and serves it up hot.Sometime, of course, it’s got to be sampled. When Jan samples, he’s using game sounds as heard on his EP Drum Sounds. On one particular track he recorded a round of Space Invaders and built it into his beat. The melodies from games however, are not sampled. They’re ‘original’ copies made with the help of plug-ins. The boys from Jahtari aren’t just recycling old wrecks, but respectfully honouring the oldschool elders. Tune into their recent Monkey Island bootleg mix — a dub tribute that came wrapped up appropriately in a little online adventure game.Disrupt vs Bo MarleyJan has created something new with his Disrupt project. But that doesn’t mean that everyone releasing at Jahtari has to follow his lead. The primary directives are having fun, being your freaky self, and loving reggae and dub. One such freak also on Jahtari is Bo Marley.Bo Marley is the Danes Max, Benjamin, Kristian und Theis. It’s also Jan’s hottest dish on the dub menu. In their fun tracks Bo Marley fuses dada-esque mutated German text with live instruments that the band has hunted down on their Space Echo trips. The result is original, catchy music, that you can’t get out of your head nor shake off your tapping feet.As opposed to many other netaudio artists, Bo Marley is anything but a studio band. Together with Disrupt they have rocked such festivals as Fusion in Germany or Jazzjuice in Aarhus, Denmark. But Bo Marley are actually best known for their spontaneous live acts in public. They cruise over hill and dale in their jerry-built Space Echo analog electronic caravan and put on shows of Danish dub in dead-end streets and market squares. The accidental audience is stunned but also thrilled enough to stop and dance.Disrupt and Bo Marley are a perfect match. Together they’ve also released a conventional CD, the first ever produced by Jahtari. Bo Marley vs. Disrupt is a concept album of small trilogies strung together from different Bo Marley tracks. Each trilogy begins with an old-fashioned ‘Tracker’ intro produced on an Amiga, followed by the actual Bo Marley track. Disrupt then rounds it all out by remixing it in his dub style. Very Jahtari.The CD is available for a very friendly price and is sent by Jan himself. Included is your Bo Marley button of choice and good vibrations. The first physical release from Jahtari stays true to the netlabel concept though: you can listen to the whole album online.Flea market fortuneJahtari — where Jan does most of the label work besides releasing his own tracks — is an uplifting example of free music culture and how to release and market your own stuff. This simply wasn’t possible 15 years ago. That Jan is now invited to festivals and getting DJ gigs and that thousands are hearing and loving what he does, is only thanks to the internet and the netlabel idea of making and sharing music. “I could ever charge people for a faceless MP3 that would just end up on somebody’s hard drive. MP3 encoding costs pretty much nothing,” says Jan. But what about the creative value of his music? “Music will always be made, no matter what. The only question is, what will it cost to bring it to people.”Ultimately, both MP3s and CDs seem a little inappropriate for the sound of Jahtari. “Reggae and dub are actually vinyl music,” says Jan. Unlike techno and other electronica that works fine in the MP3 format, dub in digital formats never really caught on. Vinyl and reggae culture simply grew up 100% together. No wonder Jan is constantly being asked when the Jahtari stuff is finally coming out on vinyl. Soon, he says. In the future real record releases are going to take priority over netlabel downloads. Not just because of demand but because of Jan’s utter love of it. “I want 7”s you can throw on the turntable. I want 10”s, 12”s on 45, LPs and covers for the shelf. I want people to stumble over Jahtari stuff in record shops and in 10 years to find it again at the flea market where, of course, it’ll carry a collector’s item price tag,” he says. “That’s how reggae works. And hopefully this will never change.” Full analog 8-bit rewind going fast forward!In the meantime impatient DJs keep cutting their own Jahtari dubplates and a pipeline full of net releases by old and new Jahtari artists will rock your DSL. At least that’s the promise we extract from Jan before he waves goodbye and heads back into his 8-bit-chip-dub-digital-laptop-reggae wonderland. You know, where Pac-Man’s high on dope not pills and the Giana Sisters have dreads.Links to JahtariWebsite: Jahtari.orgTranslation from German into English: Stepha ZanellaPhotography by Matthias H.

It’s like a trip to a peaceful surrealistic world.Feldmaus - “Lively Inner Shore” (MP3)Feldmaus - “The Sky Turned (feat. Imachi Akira)” (MP3)Feldmaus - “Put On A Magical Hood” (MP3)Passage Netlabel is an ambient sub-division of Fragment Music netlabel established in 2009. While the russians deliver HiFi-Minimal Techno and similiar tracks on Fragment Music the main course of Passage is to explore the deepest and most charming forms of abstract musical expression. Passage is handling flexible style borders with several main settings - flowing ambience, organic structure and depth./images/feldmaus.gif”Feldmaus is a collaboration between Evgeny Shchukin and Alexander Tochilkin both known as Modul. The title of their album describes best what the music is about: spaces where you find musical ambience in each corner.Starting off slowly and subtle with “Sunbeams In High Grass” and “Lively Inner Shore” you will listen to ambient music with a subtle 4-to-the-floor kickdrum like a pulsating heart. In one of those tracks Japanese guitarist Imachi Akira joined with Feldmaus to build a fantastic trip through space and time in track called “The Sky Turned (feat.

And eventually, the artwork ain’t too bad.Raleigh Moncrief- “Goldrush (Chandeliers Remix)” (MP3)Raleigh Moncrief- “Similies” (MP3)Raleigh Moncrief- “Combed Over Chrome” (MP3)Ah c’mon! I can’t find out ANYTHING about neither “Raleigh Moncrief” nor the remixers (?) “Chandeliers” and “Dash!”. Obstructive Vibrations, please! Moncrief is from Cali, is he? Everything I got is the private Myspace of designer Brandon Kalarney and these five tunes…Well. “Combed Over Chrome” is massive. Spliffed-out and dirty. Fresh and experimental, yet catchy and compatible with any Hip Hop and Dubstep dancefloor. Astro Nautico, well-informed source for Bay Area Rap as usual, says “Hudson Mohawke and Matthew David had a baby and named him Raleigh Moncrief”, and that’s a good comparison indeed.All five tracks are dope. While “Combed Over Chrome” features heavy beats and glittering synth arpreggios, “Goldrush (Chandeliers Remix)” focuses on IDM-ish melodies and baaad ass bass. With “Similies”, Raleigh Moncrief fuses wobble-wobble Dubstep with an Old School Hip Hop beat and Mohawkesque synth leads. Timeless. Eventually, “Quiet Please” closes the chromo dance with a deep ‘n’ dirty piece of solanaceous Dubstep that equally sounds L.A. and London.

It operates inbetween the genres techno, trance and elektro and melts everything in a classic way together. On the one side you feel warm synthesizer grooves and trip on those fine appregiators and on the other side you listen to those classy drummachines and the fabulous 909 and 808 kicks.Isma Serrano - “She Is Electric” (MP3)Isma Serrano- “Everything Is Alright” (MP3)Isma Serrano- “Mi Eleccion” (MP3)I like this album because it remains somehow calm, friendly and chilly. Nothing really spectacular hides between the patterns, no freaky sound experiments scrape your your. All but solid grooves and reflections of the past when techno still had this trancy flavor. When techno was more than minimal, when techno was still pure sound, when techno was friendly.Just listen to a track like “She Is Electric”. Have a seat on the rolling 808-elektro-rhythm and smile happy about those synthesizer sweeps. Than proceed and taste some of the sweet acid bleeps in “Processing”.

I’m quite positive unbreakable Resting Bell will not cease with Slow’s latest EP “Dual Box”. Actually, there are already two new releases online as I’m writing… Well. “Dual Box” is kinesope Ambient at it’s best. Experimental and august.Slow - “Miracle” (MP3)Slow - “Ioma” (MP3)Slow - “Insomia” (MP3)Wonderful we get such music for free! Even more as it’s Fall in Middle Europe and it does not take much imagination to syncronize to contemplative songs of Slow to the sound of rain on the other side of the window.Behind the telling moniker is young Sergey Suokas, hailing from Karelia, Russia, close to Finland. Sergey released a lot of music under different names, including a set of 12”s for his Techno outfit Suokas. The US-American record label Self Storage published the first full-length Slow album just recently (“Sealand”), and “Dual Box” is Sergey’s second EP for Resting Bell already. His engagement with experimental Ambient duo Feldmaus is worth a note as well. Boy… he’s a maniac!&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1422” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/suo16_600.jpg”It always feels a bit stupid to connect geographical ancestry and sound identity.  However, with all Slow release so far I had the strong impression that Sergey Soukas combines something somehow Scandinavian with something somehow Russian. Quixotic, naive melodies on the one hand, clear and focussed song writing on the other. His sound design is lush and playful.I only have a very few timeless favourites in Ambient music, among these probably Nest and Direwires &amp; Freder, but “Dual Box” by Slow has a realistic chance become classic as well.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadDownload: “Dual Box” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: sergeysuokas.ruRelease: Slow - “Dual Box”Netlabel: restingbell.net",

I tend to say she sounds very Swedish although I can not explain what this means - maybe it’s the very rolemodel Nina Persson burned into my mind. Hard to resist however.Despite her voice and the fact Emilie writes beautiful and mesmerizing melodies, her songs are always more than just folky lullabies. There is a strong 60s feel about her selftitled EP. I can hear she is up for the likes of Vashti Bunyan, Nick Drake, Brian Wilson, Van Dyke Parks and everything in-between. Still the record does not sound dated by any chance.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1413” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/emilie_lund_phlowmag.jpg”Emilie Lund opens a jewel case filled with delicate Art-Pop, dreamful abstractions of US-American Folklore and these little bit of edges I called black spots in the introduction.

            "content": "IDM Jam Session // The first of the twins is the endearing and imaginative way that Chris Da Mouse, aka 2nd Mouse (could that be his real name?), introduced his new album “Levite” in an email that pinged into my inbox less than a week ago. This album is indeed the first of two works compiled, I am told, during an explosively creative period of six months when, due to being internet-less, he was able to concentrate on living life and making music. Well, I’m pleased to say that the big net machine’s loss was music’s gain, as he put his time to excellent use.2nd mouse - “Times are hard for dreamers” (MP3)2nd mouse - “Fistful of beats” (MP3)2nd mouse - “Ai Moo” (MP3)2nd mouse- “So, tell me Oscillato” (MP3)2nd Mouse describes his music as being like Plaid, Depeche Mode, Aphex Twin and Square Pusher having a jam session - imagine what a party that would be. So, with this illustrious company in mind, standards are set very high.Mister Da Mouse chooses his sounds well with an ear to individual combinations of both classic and new sounds that cause you to re-assess your assumptions. “Levite” is an album whose feel is, in one respect, cinematic; tracks such as “Times are hard for dreamers” and a “Fistful of beats” create a sense of place, atmosphere and narrative in the listener that is evocative and entrancing. On the other hand Levite is also an album stuffed full with good old synth pop tunes. Throughout there is a sense of playfulness.The already well honed sense of melody, displayed with such aplomb in his previous album “An Armful Of Opposite Lock” has now been refined. This, allied to an undoubted sense of creative confidence that comes with hitting one’s stride, produces some delightful and surprising moments of wry musical wit and humor. Where “An Armful” had more moments of darkness “Levite” is an exercise in balance. A track like “Drone Revolt”, which has something of the nasty about it, contains an excitable super fast keyboard lick to offset the sinister elements. What we have here is a mature collection of compositions that deploy pop sensibilities and mix them intelligently with more cutting edge elements to produce exquisite tracks such as “So, tell me Oscillator” and “Ai Moo”. Here there are parallels with the music of the excellent King Bastard from Herb Recordings.The wistful and atmospheric “Times are hard for dreamers” transports you to a caberet club, complete with crooning vocals from Mister Da Mouse, brushed drums, string and echoed guitar strikes and meandering keyboards. This is down at heal dreaming; a nostalgia for a past yet to happen; a place for gin soaked regrets from the future. On “So, tell me Oscillator” inspiration is drawn from the little known electronic artist Plone and continues in a retro 50s kitch vibe often favoured by 2nd Mouse. This kitch element is further explored in the whimsical “Fistful of beats” a Spaghetti-western themed track complete with clomping woodblock sound and honkey-tonk-esque piano.I enjoyed the previous offering, “An Armful of Opposite Lock”, because of 2nd Mouse’s ability to imaginatively combine classic synth sounds with unusual and unexpected elements, without making it seem forced. Levite takes this a step further in what is an album of both considerable maturity and childish pleasure. Can’t wait for the second twin, “Minerva”, to be born on www.sampleoakrecords.com.

Eventually that led them to a path where different musical tastes were found.It is good to notice how the words “new” and “discover” can easily merge into what we usually call “evolution”. So basically this means Lars Meijer, Coen Polack and Jantijn Prins bring us this new release as the result of the progressive change on their musical tastes. The complexity and density of their tracks remain intact, but the several layers of sound are now refined.“Field recordings, electronic minimalism and acoustic maximalism” were blent with such various styles, redefining the band’s bounderies in a studio. They reconstructed their own patterns of what music production might be, allowing the existence of new sonorities, where there is no space for inconsistency. Everything plays a specific role in the track as a whole, letting harmony breath there.

It may act like a diva (detunes randomly, hisses like hell) but eventually you get a sound that has soul and a physical form. The Latvian duo Astrowind took the hard road and conquered their machines.Astrowind - “Lost And Found On The Moon” (MP3)Astrowind - “Mute Pilot” (MP3)Astrowind are Kriipis Tulo and Mahi Bukimi. I follow them since their first releases at long-gone ElektroSound Netlabel and their retro-style synthesizer Ambient always made a little bell ring in my head. After two record that did not get me too much, this one is just right again. “Fresh Wind in the Valley of Dreams” is released on the young Moldavian Netlabel Silent Flow.Astrowind play old Russian synthesizer, record their jams live on tape (!) to carefully rework them at home (I love the idea they do it with a cutting knife and Scotch tape but I guess on this account they do NOT do analogue). Outcome is multicoloured streams of dense synthesizer Ambient, enhanced by extensive pedal processing and vocal samples from Soviet cosmonautics (In particular, “Fresh Wind in the Valley of Dreams” is dedicated to A. A. Leonov).Astrowind music flows like water. And like water can vary from runlet to tsunami, Tulo and Bukimi play with dynamics as well. Modus operandi changes from lovely to destructive, from contemplative to rude health - but the overall mood is august mellifluence. The cosmonautics reference works beautifully as well and given this, the link to 70’s German Kosmische Musik ain’t too far-fetched.

Brian Grainger hooks up with long-time partner David Tagg to delivers an epic four track EP for the US-American Ambient imprint Rope Swing Cities. It is about a year the “Sawdust Aromatics” EP has been released but the record is timeless and worth a listen no matter how old.Brian Grainger - “Summer’s Parting Ways” (MP3)Recently, my focus shifted a bit from the Ambient and post structuralist music I have been reviewing for Phlow since the beginning. This is quite a natural process. But every once a while, a record hits me like a slingshot and throws me back in time. This happened for Tiago Sousa’s debut LP (available via Humming Conch soon). And it happend for “Sawdust Aromatics” by the likes of David Tagg and Brian Grainger.Allow for a brief historical abstract. David Tagg was behind the wheel at Expanding Electronic Diversity. In 2006, David and Brian Grainger of Milieu Music met to first found a band and subsequently launch the experimental music imprints Install Sound and Second Sun Recordings, the later of which is an exclusive market place for their own collaborative music. “The Future of  Modern Guitar”, as we can learn at the SSR info site.For “Sawdust Aromatics”, Rope Swing Cities (another key player in US experimental music) compiles two songs of each Tagg and Grainger, giving a total running time of +50 minutes. Brian Graingers pieces are intensively harmonic mediations on simple guitar motives. The epic “Summer Parting Ways” exactly feels like late Summer paralysis, with a wonderful synth texture beneath delayed guitar. The howling and otherworldly processings in the later half of the song are mesmerizing.David Tagg, in contrast, focuses less on harmonics but the Gordian entanglements of field-recordings and processed guitar. Rather sound design than song, Grainger’s composition are more easily to get into. Still, beyond the crackling textures of David Tagg’s music, a lot of goodness can be found.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadDownload: “Sawdust Aromatics” (ZIP)Artist-Website: David Tagg // Brian GraingerRelease: “Sawdust Aromatics”Netlabel: ropeswingcities.com",

I am sorry, but I’m a lame detective and have no answers for you. However, I can assure you that once you start to listen to it, you probably will not stop the music before you get to the very last second, because it is just like a movie.You get the opportunity to smile, to laugh, to think about life, and maybe shed one or two tears while you do it. Actually, you can find a bit of every emotion in the record, from smooth jazz to melancholic piano solos. The best thing about it? Probably the fact that you can choose your own screenplay, in order not to get disappointed. But with a soundtrack like this, I severely doubt that you can dream about a bad plot.Review written by Rute CorreiaMP3 Music DownloadDownload: Evgeny Grinko – “Cinematic Melodies EP” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: Evgeny GrinkoRelease: Evgeny Grinko – “Cinematic Melodies EP”Netlabel: www.raig.ru",

            "title": "Netaudio Berlin 2009 – A Spectacular Creative Commons Festival",
            "author": "Moritz »mo.« Sauer",
            "category": "",
            "content": "Don Ludwig, Antina Michels and Raimund Reintjes prepared one - if not the most - exciting creative commons festival in 2009. Netaudio Berlin 2009 will present nearly hundred artists, groups or music projects making noise in the free culture movement called netaudio. Since weeks music lovers from all over europe wait for the festival. We interviewed Antina and Raimund to get to know what will happen in october in Berlin.After two years the second Netaudio Gathering in Berlin will open its gates from 8th to the 11th of October. Who is taking part in the Netaudio Berlin Festival and who are the main creators of the event?Who is taking part? It would be a long list if we were to mention all the artists, speakers and participants! Solely the night program from Thursday to Saturday contains close to a hundred artists, groups or music projects. The free daytime program on Friday and Saturday is also packed with workshops, lectures, discussions, showcases and various art installations resp. performances. It would be better for you to flip through the lineup on our website.Your second question is a lot easier to answer. The main driving forces behind the Netaudio Festival Berlin are – ladies first – Antina Michels, a European Ethnographer and author of the book about “Netlabels – social networks on- and offline”, Don Ludwig – free Graphic Designer and long time Netaudio activist (Pentagonik, Netlag etc.) and Raimund Reintjes, an Event Manager and Netaudio Supporter, who emblazed the initial flame to the Berlin Festival activities in 2007. But without the network of activists: Henry, Sarah, Jon, Timor, Kevin, Kirsten, Hannes, Volker, Saskia and some more friends surrounding us, a festival of this velocity would still only be a dream.What is the main driving force behind your engagement for the free music movement, also known as creative commons music or netaudio? Why do you have such a love for this culture so that you spend so much of your time creating such a festival?Raimund: It’s the strong belief that there should be a fair and a strong relationship between the artist (formerly known as the producer), the music (formerly known as the product) and the listener (formerly known as the consumer). Creative Commons on the legal – and netlabels on the physical side of life provide the best starting point. I have realized in the past 15-20 years to re-organize the perverted relations within the music business we have to start from the very beginning, to bring the whole thing back on its feet again – but so many artists, music lovers and professionals are working on this subject.It’s exciting to see the growing impact and effects this movement has had on the rules of the game already. Music is basically something to touch your heart and soul – not for the profit of a few big companies. Netaudio is bringing dignity back into the music business by eliminating the financial aspect as the roots of engagement. This is not the end of the story – but it’s meant to wipe out the conditions of greed and replace them with an economy of trust and attention.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1353” title=”netaudio_berlin_ausschnitt_” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/netaudio_berlin_ausschnitt_.gif”Antina: The festival is the practical realisation of more theoretical thoughts in my book. The festival also stands for the “face to face” interactions, stepping away from the internet as Andi Studer from the Netaudio Festival London 2008 has previously remarked: “The offline festival for online music.”Netaudio needs the real life physical exchange – and thrives from it. The participants and guests will have personable experiences together; strengthening the relationships already formed online and making new friendships face to face. These contacts can be valuable for musical and artistic collaborations which become possible by the connections made at the festival, as an example the Trioon project which is a collaboration between J-Lab (former Netaudio London, now Berlin), Dr. Nojoke (Netaudio Berlin) and Servando (Spain, now Berlin). The Festival also allows the artists to promote themselves, to be heard and to raise their profile.One aspect of my personal motivation is the practical/my experience of a ‘community of practice’ – (a form of collaboration in a team, which is based on- and offline communications, a learning concept developed by Lave and Wenger) working and learning together under the recent circumstances like project orientated, temporally limited collaboration. It facilitates the in-sight in collective, co-working and (co-) learning processes. I have to admit that my research instinct comes up sometimes ;)Another aspect of my motivation is the opportunity to bring people from different cultural backgrounds together, to give them the possibility of exchange, for example in discussions. In equal measure more informal meetings are important and motivating: having fun together on the dance floor, listening to music, chatting, catching up and networking at the netaudio fair. In this way ‘offline contexts’ and a feeling of belonging are created. This gives the possibility of remembering ‘former’ online friends more enduringly than if it were just left at a single online contact.What has changed during the last two years? What can we expect from Netaudio Berlin and why should we come?Raimund: mo. – you should be coming because we invited you to moderate a round table discussion about online distribution and the role of netlabels as a hinge between the “market” and the creative output of the artists! All the others should come to watch you of course…Ahem… ok, we’ve invited a few more experts for an informative daytime program. There will be some 40 netlabels presenting themselves – so if you are an artist and in search of top level contacts within the netaudio scene – we have a plethora of them. And if you love exploring the progressive developments in music &amp; styles you should not miss our widespread night program with all sorts of electronic music like Techno, Minimal and House – but also Dubstep and Drum’n’Bass, Triphop and Nujazz, Pop, Dub, 8-Bit, HipHop, Techdub and especially the Experimantal Stage at the opening night on Thursday… The variety of styles is one of the main attractions, also the extension of the festival which now starts on Thursday. We have also extended the daytime program - which now has two long afternoons and three parallel branches of activities. We have also upgraded to a better venue – which has provided us with some better working conditions. We do not have to squat in order to have enough space…In spring you called for entries. Now the program is finished. How many entries did you get and under which criteria did you choose the artists? What was your main goal?We got roundabout 150 entries. But through a multi-leveled procedure and also through the required amount of information we tried to support requests from those artists who really wanted to get involved in this specifically – and not just in any other festival. We tried to give some extra support to artists from Eastern countries. So we have now announced artists from Ukraine, Belarus, Hungary, Czech Rep., Slovakia, Turkey, Russia, Poland, Morocco and Serbia – and we hope that they all get visas and permission from the authorities to play in Berlin. Other criteria were mainly subjective. We’ve chosen what we liked the most. Around half of the program is filled with artists from the “Call for Entries”, the other half has been asked by our bookers if they would like to take part. We thought this would be a fair arrangement between our own ideas and the offers from the communities.When organising and inviting musicians and artist to such a happening like Netaudio Berlin, I’m sure everybody has their own favorites. Which musicians or artist are your favorites and what do you yourself not want to miss?&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1352” title=”netaudio-ping-pong” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/netaudio-ping-pong.jpg”  Netaudio Ping Pong: partly music performance, partly a game for all to play.Raimund: As I have been in charge of the booking for the Experimental Floor and the Dub &amp; Techdub Floor you’ll find nearly all my favorites here. For sure I am also very happy about a whole bunch of artists on other floors – and I helped on decisions with one or two of the others. But to be honest I am really proud that we can present something like the Experimental Floor on Thursday.There has never been such a line-up at a musical event before. It is a unique combination of artists and due to the nature of their music you would never normally see them billed at this time, on this day, in this setting, so we are very pleased to be able to offer them and the visitors this treat. Here we have about eight representatives with extremely creative and free minds, experimenting with sounds and musical atmospheres all combined on one floor! And the Dub &amp; Techdub Floor on Saturday contains a close to perfect selection of my personal favorites. I can’t live without one or the other release of their music on my mp3 player – always ready to sweeten my days…Antina: The most interesting thing about a festival is a variety of styles, not only music genres, but also varied forms of presentation like musical showcases, audio-visual performances, films, discussions, workshops, lectures and ping pong sessions. Personally, I’m especially glad to welcome reggae, dub and 8-bit artists in the night program and also to have more experimental, downtempo and ambient artists in the day program. The netlabel showcases will open up the possibility to chat, network and enjoy the music at the same time.Besides music in the evening Netaudio Berlin also focuses on other creative commons art forms and has some knowledge to offer. What exactly?We are showing, for example, a selection of CC-movies from Stefan Kluge of VEB Leipzig – who informs us about the ideas behind CC movies and also why they even allow these movies to be used for commercial purpose… Then we have the netaudio ping pong game, an interactive game which uses netaudio sounds. We also have some field recording projects with concerts, sound- and net-installations as well as an exhibition on netlabels. Also there are a lot of discussions about various aspects of CC on the daytime program.In many contracts with the musicians you “signed” the music of the artists. Do you plan to offer free live recordings afterwards?We will record the whole festival for our own documentation and maybe for live streaming – but also we might release some of the recorded material afterwards. There are only a few artists who do not want that. In matters of post-festival releases we are maybe a little more interested in the intellectual outcome of the day program. We’d love to think about spoken word releases like lectures and discussions. There are enough netlabels to release high quality netaudio music. But there is no such thing like a publisher for CC-audio books resp. intellectual creative commons.Only here and there you’ll find single releases of this kind. We would like to develop this aspect. But we might also release some live sets of the music program. If everything goes well we might broadcast a live radio and live net-radio from the festival – but the venue is very difficult for that. During the next few days we are investing a lot of time, energy and also some money in trying to set up an infrastructure for broadband streaming. It would be so nice - and also appropriate…Thank you very much for the interview and see you at Netaudio Berlin 2009 in october!",

It was back in 2006 when Geert van der Velde wrote a song for his girlfriend. She must have liked it. They married and Geert formed a band. The Black Atlantic was born. Two years, several gigs and countless jams later, the group has recorded its debut album, “Reverence for Fallen Trees”. It was created over the fall of 2008 in a log cabin in the Adirondack Mountains.It seems as if Velde and his band took a deep breath to capture the world around and inside of them - “Reverence for Fallen Trees” is the introspective and intimate outcome. For the lovers of soft tunes and sweet melodies, The Black Atlantic might be a new favorite band that it’s really worth watching out for.Virtual omnipresence. The Black Atlantic do the right thing. As an indie band, the dutch four-piece has not only signed to a wonderful and dedicated netlabel (Beep! Beep!), they are also virtually omnipresent. Next to their official site, they use Twitter, Myspace, Last.fm, Hyves, Facebook, Mininova and man, they are on Wikipedia! That’s how it should be!

            "content": "Lush Ambient, Crunchy Beats // Hot off the heels of mo.’s Para-review last week, I got to let you know about the latest Archaic Horizon releases: “Nowcast” by Trenton McElhinney, more commonly known as 2%. I’ve been listening to both records in a row and found them doing fairly well in these days of late Summer haze.2% - “Leeward” (MP3)2% - “Glory” (MP3)Californian Trenton McElhinney is a tech-savvy kid. For his second EP “Nowcast” he is using Max/ MSP, the Monome controller and his acoustic guitar. While the pattern-based programmings of the Monome do not easily allow for crazy breakbeat frenzy, it suits the 2% music perfectly well: monochrome, rich textures and crunchy Hip Hop beats.“Stop”, you might want to object, “All music at Archaic Horizon sounds like this!” - fairly true, but somehow 2% does better than most. Microloops dream in concentric stagger, textures intensively fill the room with warm noise and canny harmonies. A certain feel for what is necessary is manifest in McElhinney’s music. Here is another connection to Para I guess: minimalism as compository guideline.&lt;img class=”alignnone” src=”http://6.media.tumblr.com/iaoj3xvgXolndsiaPWN6ps8No1_500.jpg”Young McElhinney is a man of taste and virtuosity. His art- and photoworks supply a fine complement to his music and are worth a minute of your attention, e.g., whilst listening to the “Nowcast” EP. Archaic Horizon sums it all up: “2% loops samples into vaporous drones creating a milky haze for his melodies to refract within then drops beats that land you back on solid ground.” Wooord!MP3 Ambient Music DownloadDownload: “Nowcast” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: myspace.com/2pourcentRelease: 2% - “Nowcast”Netlabel: archaichorizon.com",

I found the track on the average compilation “apegenine volume two” released by the apegenine Label. “Possibilities” from Henrik Jose totally blows me away with its pop-appeal, idm-ish sounds and a beautiful voice. Since I discoverd Henrik Jose on the “Cycles” compilation by Camomille I am a huge fan.Henrik Jose “Possibilities” (MP3)I truly love this slightly pathetic voice of Henrik Jose. I adore these little electronic experiments with sounds. And I simply get hooked by the frenetic flavor of “Possibilies”. It’s warm, enthusiastic and beautiful. It made my day.The whole compilation called “hypocondriac” doesn’t work for me in general. I skipped a lot of the tracks. To many different styles, sometimes to dark, sometimes just boring. There are only two more interesting songs to mention. One is called “jesus was a b-boy (makunouchi bento remix)” which is heavily inspired by the sound of Burnt Friedmann. It’s a playful spoken-word-hip-hop-track.

The artist’s name is Oskar Hallbert and he brings forth a new shade to the monochrome Zymogen label sound. Lo-fi Folk scribbles, you kidding? No.Oskar Hallbert - “21 (Unsent Letter)”Oskar Hallbert - “03 (From the Stockholm Tape 2)”Oskar Hallbert is a Swedish composer who does not only incorporate instruments like piano, guitar and woodwinds in his music but intensively focuses on blurry field recordings and the warm hiss you got from cheap microphones. Beauty, in case of Hallbert, seems to happen as in passing. Like not intended. In a sudden, harmonies cross and form melodies, then move apart again. A moiré effect.This is wonderfully fragile- and the more you don’t expect a song to touch you the more you’re moved if it does, eventually. For me, Oskar Hallbert is a kindred spirit to Vienna wunderkind David Schweighart whose album is online for free with 12rec. Netlabel and worth every second as well.Hallbert’s EP “Sids Apartment” (ZIP link!) was out on Rainmusic in 2008. You easily will agree that the French label is the perfect place for music like his. “1123581321345589” was released on an US CDR label before, now luckily Zymogen re-publishes the 10 + 79 tracks (!) for free.

He can’t stick to one idea or just one loop for one track. On the other hands, that’s his strong part. You have to listen to his music more than once.

I asked Andrey of Nexsound for “Decivilice After Consumption” when I informed him about the review I wrote for his latest record- and he told me that the album is done already and waiting to be released. After Giovanni’s first album was free for download, “Decivilice” comes off as a beautifully wrapped CD.Bluermutt - “Before Going To Bed” (MP3)Bluermutt - “Fashion Arithmetics” (MP3)Bluermutt refined his style on “Decivilice After Consumption”. While “When I’m Not” showed Giovanni Civitenga’s addiction to leftfield Pop only in traces, the new Bluermutt album can be considered an avowal to groove, melody and vocals in general. Therefore, it suits the Nexsound Pickup-series beautifully.Be aware: Bluermutt music is light years away from radio-friendly muzak. But Giovanni’s stumbling IDM and Hip Hop beats are do not stand isolated in tracks but form songs nowadays. Bluemutt is accompanied by a vocalists Fredo Viola, Steph Thirion and Linn Rasimelli plus a series of random sample voices. The wonky IDM hymn “Fashion Arithmetic” is outstanding, “Self Approach” strongly reminds me of Canadian Electropop wizard adcBicycle and “Before Going To Bed” is nothing but bewitching.&lt;img class=”alignnone” src=”http://www.skyapnea.com/home_of_bluermutt/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/copies-2-750.jpg”Much goodness can be found along the way.

I like he subtle guitar meditation “Jimmy Coda” a lot, and “Daily Explosions” with songstress Kinn Rasimelli with all its out-of-space synthesizers is uplifting. Last but not least, it should be noted that the opening “Welcome To A Clear Bluer Sky” features Rap wunderkind Dorian Concept on synths.

In 2009, after his epochal “Somewhere Between the Sun and the Moon” CD album, Wim started a project called “12 Records in 12 Month”. On a monthly basis, Wim releases a new EP, each 20 -25 minutes in length. June is especially great.Wixel - “Skatebeats” (MP3)Wixel - “Bacterial” (MP3)I’m a keen fan of Belgian Wim Maesschalck’s work and music since 2004. Starting as a solo outfit, Wixel soon became a band with Wim as central songwriter. The latest Wixel CDs “Heart” and “Somewhere Between the Sun and the Moon” in particular are wonderful pieces of postmodernism Folk- and Avantgarde music everyone should be familiar with.2009 saw the launch of Wim’s “12 Records in 12 Month” project. Up to now, six records are online for download via bandcamp. You can choose what you want to pay for the MP3, including nothing, or you go for the limited edition CDRs available from Slaapwel (the tiny record label Wim is running).-The June EP “An Empty Canvas” is the preliminary highlight of the series. Wim discards the fragile Folk approach and delivers a dense piece of dim and orchestral Ambient, not too far from Gas, Nest or 1970’s German Electronica like Cluster or Tangerine Dream. Wim himself notes Arvo Pärt and Dubstep for influence. Check “Skatebeats” and the massive “Bacterial” to get an idea.What I like best about “An Empty Canvas” is the multilayer sound. A lot of dirt and noise twinkles through the washed-out textures and synthesizer patches, you can discover new aspects on every new listen. The beats, however, could deserve some more elaboration. But taking in account the facts this record was programmed in a month, that is pretty OK I guess.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadArtist-Website: slaapwelrecords.com/wixelRelease: **Wixel - “An Empty Canvas” via bandcamp**",

Take a look:But hey - I would not write this if the music didn’t kick me at all! Red Box Recorder (aka “DJ Particle Fusion”, lol) came a long way, picking the best from Drum &amp; Bass, Hip Hop, Downbeat and Soul music. The outcome, however, is difficult to categorize.There is a wealth of instruments used, and they mix beautifully with the complex beat patterns. Some tunes recall older Ninja Tunes records, some feature influences from UK breakbeat more clearly. Programmings are always soulful and performed with a good sense of musicality. I had to think of Koen Park and Resynthsize every now and then. “Colour Codes” is a bit too long to be without a spot, but a lot of goodness can be found in here!",

Producers publish beat tapes to introduces themselves to the scene and pave the way for possible cooperations. Usually, these tapes are collections of beats rather than perfectly produced songs. Typical beat tapes show a variety of styles in maybe 20 different skits, each lasting one to two minutes. The best-known beat tapes are “Donuts” by J Dilla (I mean, face it) and the “Rap Beats Vol. 1” CDR by Samiyam.Here’s three free beat tapes for beginnersThe First Space Shit on the Moon” was published via the Kwatro collective and features 30 sketches of warm and semi-electronic Rap beats. His tape is highly musical, razor sharp and sounds pretty much now. Definitive must-have, kids!Download fLako’s “The First Space Shit on the Moon” via zshareNext in line is Portland cat Hi-Res. This funky guy released his soulful tape “1080 Beats” via myspace just recently, and it’s really worth a listen. Dusty-jazzy beats and samples set Hi-Res apart from most producers in the game and save the kid a top ranking in the Post-Dilla charts.

There is a certain sickness about both bands mainly due to the sluggish guitar play of Kauders. For his solo output, Kauders got into Avant-Garde Pop rather than Rock.

Catchy melodies, uplifting beats, rough sounds. So far, this is true for a lot of chip music releases. But Cornbeast’s “Chip Hero” brings along more than just 20 minutes dancefloor energy. Below his bleepy textures, gameboy Fredrik hides well-written songs with melodies that make stick and do not solely work by making you remember your Nintendo handheld.This is the case especially for “Megablast”, “Chip Hero” and the ballad “Sparks”.

Their debut album “Die Tugend Von Heute” is online for free via b.solid record label. Coehn &amp; Foehrb bring forth fresh Rap and block-bustin’ beats from 1990 to 2010. Highly recommend!Coehn &amp; Foehrb - “Dejavue” (MP3)Coehn &amp; Foehrb - “Mittel Zum Finger” (MP3)Coehn &amp; Foehrb - “Nixtape” (MP3)For sure: if you are able to understand kid Coehns’ streetwise and funny Rap lyrics, it is more easy to dig “Die Tugend Von Heute”. Coehn &amp; Foerhb kick Hip Hop like it was big in Germany in the late 90’s - straight forward, funky beats, Hip Hop that focuses on Rap with a storytelling vibe. Nice but not too decent, Coehn is a lyricist that knows about Raps’ history but is able to extrapolate as well. His rhymes fit the beats of Stuttgart homies Foerhb, Radsch und Naturtalent seamlessly and although Coehn is not pushing genre borders, his styles are far above the genre common level.&lt;img class=”left size-full wp-image-1235” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/coehnfoehrb-cartoon.jpg”However, there is no exclusive need to understand the lyrics. Coehns’ flow is highly enjoyable, and the beats exhibit an interesting variety from Golden Age to influence from Dubstep and synth-driven electrorap.

He interlaces field recordings with musical elements (some percussive, some traces of instruments) and drops smithereens of conversation (French language). Mobin a.k.a. Anthony Baron uses the full range of the audible spectrum, from high frequent noises to subsonic audio events. Most of the time, his Music Concrète-composition is beautifully pure although most sources are hard to guess. Every now and then, however,  Anton Mobin radically enhances the  intensity of his track, resulting in bursts of curiously non-aggressive noise I have scarcely heard before.Rich and refreshing, Anton Mobin places himself right between the IDM-influenced Electro-acoustica of d’incise, Preslav Literary School and Brooklyn noise pioneers Black Dice. Thanks to konkretourist Netlabel which I discovered only with this release!By the way, Marco Medkour, one half of konkretourist, will present his “Soundmap of Cologne” at the Cologne Commons festival this weekend, 12th to 13th of June.

Low fidelity, high quality!Sky Barstow - “Can We Leave This Place” (MP3)Sky Barstow - “Closet Dance” (MP3)Robin Barstow a.k.a. Sky Barstow enjoys synthesizers and organs, “those big enormous ugly things”. He is a circuit-bending sound engineer and recorded his recent album “It’s Circuar” on an army of dirty little synths. What he get to hear is awkward chiptune hymnals, melancholy Indiepop tunes and 80’s influenced DIY Grandezza. The album did not get me on first try. But listening to it again and again, every time it got better.Most of the songs are longer than five minutes, and a lot of things happen in between. What sounds aleatoric initially turns out to be the mature profile of a talented not only knob tweaker but musician. “Can We Leave This Place”, “Closet Dance”, “It Rained All Day” and “Probably Not” are single hits with massive edges and sharp outlines. Robin Barstow mixes juvenile melancholy with queer exhibitionism, charm and a good amount of self-mockery. Can you imagine a mix between Nick Diamond and Mike Patton, ca.  Mr. Bungle?

His debut “Shmalhans is Kuechenmeister” was quite a good listen with a lot of potential hiding behind the awkward compositions. On “The Repeating Thoughts”, Gillicuddy takes the quiet moments, expands and brings them to perfection.Gillicuddy - “II” (MP3)Let’s start with the downer - behind the five tunes the tracklist promises, only two songs lurk actually. “I” and “II” are the same as “IV” and “V”, as an interlude “III” is ten seconds silence. “The Repeating Thoughts Of Old Zinng Zanng”. Got it?Gillicuddy a.k.a. Andreas Rohden is much more subtle songwriter on his new EP than it was the case on “Shmalhans is Kuechenmeister”. Both “I” and “II” are subtle and decent Folk songs that deliver a certain 60’s feeling but are far to clever to be judged retro. The two-voiced vocals are very beautiful. Gillicuddys’ songs float in a strange place in-between, they do not seem to serve any purpose. While “I” is a bit more traditional, say Wilco meets Sea &amp; Cake,  “II” takes the __song imperciptible into textural regions, makes it disappear somehow.Fading in, fading out, diappearing…  after ten seconds silence, “I” and “II” repeat themselves as “IV” and “V”.

Up next we have got V.O.M., rather an idea than a band, acting simultaneously from (at least) three different cities, all in the name of hypnotic Krautrock.V.O.M. IV - Part II, Track I (MP3)V.O.M. IV - Part II, Track IV (MP3)V.O.M. V - Part I, Track IV (MP3)V.O.M. again. The name stands for Magical Unicellular Music, and this strange name makes sense on different levels. Magical - something happens between the tracks, something unexpected, something one can not explain. Black magic rituals, Voodoo, call me names. Unicellular - the most simple form of life, evolutions successful all-in-one model. Reduced to the max. Music - well, yeah, music! V.O.M. is primitive, hypnotic, threatening… I’m prone to call it Minimal.V.O.M. was born from Minsk performance collective Solntsetsvety (Солнцецветы). On this release for the Russian Clinical Archives Netlabel, Magical Unicelluar Music is V.O.M. IV and V.O.M. V, Minsk and Moscow, respectively. Two bands, united by the ideas given above.Listening to “Камень”, it is hard to distinguish who is who. Both bands play primitive, noise-driven Krautrock, repetitiv and hypnotic. Instruments are guitar-bass-drums, plus sporadic electronic gimmicks, the whole thing mainly instrumental. V.O.M. record music half-improvised, with a stunning amount of DIY/Punk-inspired energy that sets them apart from New Age and esoteric music. In my opinion, early Can, the endless songs of Neu! and 80s’ Postpunk, especially Pop Group and Sonic Youth, are good references.The whole album makes up one hour, 40 minutes. Naturally, not every single jam is excellent. But tracks “Part II, IV” (V.O.M. V) and “Part I, IV” (V.O.M. IV) will give you a good idea about the Magical Unicellular Music sound.

It has been running on heavy rotation actually. But I never made it for a proper review. But now! Lovers of leftfield Pop, ca. Beta Band and Books, don’t miss this gem.2nd rec is a German record label that released CDs some years back. When sales went down, 2nd rec decided to sell-out and re-start as an experimental online label. “Jars, Jams &amp; You” by Italian Sicilian duo Tellaro is available for download only, and you can choose the price, including downloading the full-length album for free. We support 2nd rec and want to convince you to pay something valuable for this wonderful record.Tellaro are Francesco Cantone and Tazio Iacobacci. Their electronic Pop music is build from a billion sources, like a beautiful Frankenstein patched up from the junkyard of 40 years’ pop culture. The download package comes with a 17 sides pdf booklets including notes for every song, charming and interesting. We learn about friends making political speeches, grandmother and baby sister Iacobacci singing a song, Tazio’s uncle from the US playing slide guitar, etc. etc. Most contributions include vocal performances, not necessarily singing though.&lt;img class=”&lt;/code&gt; size-full wp-image-1185” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/tellaro_band.jpg”Wonderfully, all this makes up for a fresh, interesting and hymnal Pop record. Clever Pop music, notoriously underrated, in good tradition with acts like The Books, The Beta Band, Evil Superstars or the Anticon posse. Prelisten tracks “Dario Whorenges”, “Life Goes On” and “Bad News Don’t Need To Be Introduced” to become a believer.

            "content": "German High Gloss Pop // One might argue how much sense it makes to talk about a record that features German vocals and explicitly relies on reviewing the entanglements of music and lyrics in a magazine that is written for a mainly English-speaking readership. I am aware of this problem. Still, Cologne Pop outfit Clipper are worth a try even if you do not understand a word.Clipper - “Aus Allen Fugen” (MP3)Clipper - “Ein Konsequentes Lied” (MP3)Clipper - “Silbernes Band” (MP3)Clipper left Indiepop behind. Their vision of independent Pop music is high gloss and vulnerable on his own free will. Readers familiar with German Pop will probably see the intersections to bands like Tele, Kante and especially Blumfeld. Naive and quite the opposite to cool, Clipper position themselves right between flimsy 80’s strings, falsetto vocals and opulent arrangements. “The New Romantics of every days’ life”, true that…“Alles erscheint in einem anderen Licht” combines ten songs written between 2004 and 2008 to a coherent album. The formula throughout all songs is Pop. But be aware! All catchy Clipper melodies overlock clever and complex compositions. Beyond the 80’s icing lurks an understanding in music that has more in common with 60’s psychedelia, think of the Beach Boys, the late Beatles, and, fast forward, Talk Talk ca. “Spirit of Eden”. This is a bit much every now and then still “Alles erscheint in einem anderen Licht” has a lot of treasury to discover!MP3 Pop Music DownloadArtist-Website: www.clipper-musik.de(mouse over single tracks to right-click download)",

            "content": "Exclusive Compilation and Interview with Sebastian Redenz // From 2001 to 2008, Autoplate was the experimental subdivision of Thinner Netlabel. 50 high quality releases in eight years, the label was officially shut down three months ago with a beautiful EP by Russian Ambient outlet Slow. Time for us to get Sebastian Redenz in for a talk to shine a light on the Autoplate history and find out why the label had to cancel operation while Thinner is alive and kicking.Slow - “Morning Love”: DownloadDear Sebastian, please give our readers a brief introduction to who you are!Sebastian: My name is Sebastian Redenz, I’m 27 years and being part of a team I managed **Autoplate** as A&amp;R (Artists &amp; Requirement). I also do A&amp;R work for **Thinner**, am in the process of finishing my social sciences studies in Mannheim and am currently in the process of relocating to Frankfurt, where I work for Cocoon Recordings being my main employer.When I read about the final Autoplate release and the associated demise of the label, I felt relieved and disappointment at the same time. Disappointment because one of the most reliable Netlabels for experimental music cancelled operation, relief because you finished it with a clean cut. Why did it take so long for Autoplate to wave goodbye eventually? Was the dismissal of Autoplate part of the Thinner relaunch already?First off, thanks very much for the flowers. Indeed, the aftermath of our relaunch in 2007 things didn’t go as expected for various reasons. A new Autoplate website was planned but never entered production phase. Quite quickly after THN100 got released some major changes started to take place in the lives of all key members. Some went into fulltime employment, some started their own agency or were just busy studying, so it became obvious that the availability to contribute to a common project decreased significantly. We had to make a decision really – maintain two Netlabels on an equal marketing level, which wouldn’t allow growth or take the decision for one Netlabel and invest the saved time into marketing and developing the label.Autoplate was always on a much smaller scale compared to Thinner, the label didn’t organize any live shows and the people never left much feedback. Unsurprisingly though cause there’re indeed many excellent Netlabels releasing ambient and experimental music. So we decided to fade the project out with a final release and to concentrate on Thinner, which just has a bigger audience and potential and thus is more interesting for all of us.You are right to say that there are many excellent Netlabels for experimental music. Still, Autoplate introduced and established some big names to the scene. Think of Kevin Krebs, Jason Corder, Andrey Kiritchenko, Gultskra Artikler, Normal Music… Musicians of great talent and inspiration. The most successful is probably Martin Juhls aka Marsen Jules, ironically for both Autoplate and Thinner. Can you tell us what it was like to let him go? Martin is an recording artist now…On the one hand I was very happy for Martin. By that time we were running both labels together and thus working together closely. His Autoplate albums definitely made things easier for him to acquire a recording contract with CCO, since both albums were downloaded over five thousand times each, being a big aid for his name to become noticed for this particular sound. This particular example showed the importance of promoting the music – for both albums Martin sent a batch of CDRs to magazines and radio stations. On the other hand it was unfortunate to see him leaving as an artist who probably had the biggest impact for Autoplate.Autoplate and Thinner started in 2001. Re-listening some of the early Autoplate releases it’s quite obvious that the label sound was down to many evolutionary shifts. Does this reflect your own taste in music? Are you still interested in experimental or ambient music? Noting the impact of Marsen Jules, maybe you’d like to give our readers an impression what the stylistic development of Autoplate was due to.I tried to keep the label exciting by staying versatile and work along a bigger picture of experimental electronic music. In the beginning we only wanted to release music with a conceptual “overhead beyond the music”, inspired by Mille Plateaux. If you review the first Autoplate releases you’ll notice, they all come with album length playing time.At some point glitch became rather uninteresting to me and I started looking into acquiring more ambient and electro-acoustic music for the label. Martin’s albums came in just perfect as we were already working together before, with him releasing as “Falter” on Thinner. Starting with his album we had a string of great releases. From there Autoplate always oscillated between deep organic ambient and intimate electro-acoustic music. Another notable highlight between the studio productions was the live album by Move D, which was later re-released on Bine Music/ Raster Noton. Today I’m still interested in these particular genres, but time constraints currently make the further continuation of Autoplate impossible, unfortunately.On the Thinner blog, you started the “Netlabels Who Care” series. Do you follow the scene? Are you aware of new labels and artists? Any favorites you would like to mention?I regularly check out about ten Netlabels. I monitor what’s happening and download the one or other release, it depends on how the release is presented to get my attention. If the Netlabel properly presents a release with artwork, info text and high bitrates it is likely that I check it out. Recently I’ve came along a statement which said that Netlabels gave a new bloom to ambient and experimental music in general. I couldn’t agree more!Okay, thanks a lot for the interview and good luck for your thesis!Website: www.autoplate.cc__Farewell Autoplate!

On a basis of warm and organic IDM beats, Monokle compose epic Indiepop- and Postrock tracks that imply influence from 40 years of Popmusic (“From Can to Plaid”, as Ideology says). You can find pieces of Kraut- and Progrock, 80’s Pop, 90’s Electronica and loads more in the Monokle music. Listening to this 45 minutes, I am amazed how seamless everything engages.The album “Tesaurus” is super-versatile but works perfectly as an album, homogenous in mood and atmosphere. Vlad and Alexander blow their tracks up to massive hymns, including numerous stems of synthesizer, guitars and electronic gimmicks here and there. They do well, although most songs on “Tesaurus” don’t need all the fuzz- Monokle have the melodies to reach out for everyone.

            "content": "Stonewashed Electronica // It’s time to write about Orange Crush. His debut album “The Field”  back in 2006 got me already, but somehow I never managed to review it.

Go for it!Orange Crush - “Invocation” (MP3)Orange Crush - “Snow Bound” (MP3)Orange Crush - “Quiet Skies” (MP3)Let’s start with the obvious reference: Boards of Canada. I’m sorry, Karl, you must have heard it a thousand times… The heavy influence of the Scottish pioneers is the reason I never sang the praise of Orange Crush I guess. Solid production, good tracks but something was missing on “The Field”, Endersons’ debut for Archaic Horizon. On “Autumn Reflections”, apparently nothing has changed. The improvements, however, are subtle and essential.&lt;img class=”alignnone” src=”http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/78/l_f4522dc6883646a68860410a3b56acc1.jpg”Tonal synth- and organ chords, simple three-parts melodies, relaxed Downbeat- and Hip Hop beats, dense instrumentation, loads of atmosphere: the ingredients are the same. Now and back then, Orange Crush sounds dusty, sun-beaten and not much like Vest-Agder in Norway where Endreson lives. A spongy 70’s feel is omnipresent throughout the album, certain stems seem to wave and warp like recorded to old tapes.In the end, it’s the melodies that make “Autumn Reflections” a better record than “The Field”. Enderson is on point and writes songs rather than recording sound ideas. This is a bit more conservative, but it makes a wonderful album that gives you an idea what the Summer in 2009 may taste like.

But your precious time was absolutely worth waiting for their new release. If you like folky pop music with a little electronica here and there, you should not miss “Tree House Whispers” by the creative multiinstrumental duo Anois.Anois - Beds And Dishes (MP3)Anois - Waltz Of Wolfs (MP3)Anois - Homecall (MP3)Anois is Lars Kranholdt and Anne Baier from northern Germany. Lars is not a newbie to aerotone and the netaudioscene and neither is Anne. As This Mess Is Mine Lars already put out two bedroom folktronica EPs at aerotone. Together with his brother Daniel, he appeared on two compilations of the aerotone netlabel. As Leander they drift towards a slightly more electronica style, that can still be coined folktronica, but with less folk in it. Anne does not seem to be as busy, but hey, she doesn’t have to - as long as she keeps teaming up with Lars to create such lovely songs as they do as Anois./images/anois.jpg”“Tree House Whispers” is not the first Anois-Release. They have had a few appearances at the mexican netlabel poni republic. “Tracery On A Frosted Window” was their debut and they also did a split EP with Sunday Parlours. Now, more than one year after their release at the poni republic, they are back with new material, that is a diverse mix of original folkpoptronica. Some songs sound surprisingly happy (“Beds and Dishes), while others are full of cloudy moods and melodies that offer you quite a big sip of a sweet drink called melancholy (“November”).There is one thing about this album that makes it difficult to make up an opinion. Diversity. The 13 songs on “Tree House Whispers” somehow don’t seem to fit on this album. On the other hand it is the diversity that makes this album even more interesting to my ears. You get handclapping popsongs that make you sing along, folky tunes that have been added up with some electronic bits and pieces and sometimes there is a noisy atmosphere and experimental glitch hidden in between some bedroom-folk that comes along with lovely instruments like strings, trumpets, glockenspiel and other kling-klang stuff.This is definitely an album with a lot to discover.

On his new EP you get four bonbons, four melodic groovers full of analogue synthie sounds.My favorite track on “bonbon e.p.” is the opener called “schwedische gardinen”. The track has these bleeping sounds, we know from the early era of Bleep Techno. Along with some melodic chords this classic stomper builds up its magic slowly.

The influence of this guy on modern day Ambient music is not to overestimate! FourColour a.k.a. Keiichi Sugimoto (Cubic Music) delivers wonderfully dense Ambient/ Drone meditation on bubbling synths. The collagists’ Avant-Pop of The Focus Group (Julian House) is unsettling but fascinating.            In the later half of the album, there is Steinbrüchel to mention. His composition “b      ton” sounds like a microscopic study of background noises and unwanted hissing of a tape machine. Interestingly, it is based on a guitar recording by Daisuke Miyatani, the grand maestro of accidental folk. Music like dust. Hard Sleeper fuses field recordings, rural Acid and warm Ambient, giving an undogmatic piece of electronic music. Only Lawrence English, usually a sure shot, was sort of a disappointment to me.

For “Piano(s)”, Diatribes is accompanied by Jacques Demierre and Johann Bourquenez of Plaistow.Diatribes + Demierre + Bourquenez - “Tornade” (MP3)Jacques Demierre uses the piano as a source of sound rather than a classical instrument. Part Cecil Taylor part John Cage, his play is full of little noises and surprising tonal cascades, percussive and herein the perfect complement for Cyril Bondis’ poetic and introspect drums. Between the clusters, there is a lot of space- or none. A refreshing and rich concept that requires concentrated listening admittedly.On two tracks, Plaistow head Johann Bourquenez joins the gang. His approach to piano is much different from Demierre’s delicate boned experimentalism. “Tornade” rushes the listener with the energy of  a, well, tornado and leaves the wastelands, Jacques Demierre and Diatribes can perform their subtle improvisations on afterwards.MP3 Free Jazz Music DownloadDownload: “Piano(s)” ZIPRelease: Diatribes, Demierre &amp; Bourquenez - “Piano(s)”Netlabel: insubordinations.net****",

Within 73 minutes and basically four tracks (ranging 12 - 27 minutes), the band creates their very own sound vision blending minimal Electronica, Krautrock and Pop.Synthesizers go along with decent sound gimmicks, super simple drums and hushed vocals. Warm textures are played out to maximal duration, drums and beats are a meditation on structure, a natural pulsing rather than an instrument to agitate the crowd.

As the weather in Northern Germany is exactly like it normally is on Christmas Eve ‘round here, maybe a review makes sense. “A Whale in the Manger” brings together six artists and their interpretation of Christmas carols.Telafonica - “Angels We Have Heard On High” (MP3)Eliza Magill - “Joy To The World” (MP3)Actually, this compilation is only four songs and one musical collective:&lt;img class=”alignleft” src=”http://static.howstuffworks.com/gif/christmas-songs-16.jpg”Sydney-based Telafonica start with their version of “Angels We Have Heard On High”. Absolutely intriguing, the band contrasts their coldish Trip Hop / Electronica sound with the heavenly “Gloria, in excelsis Deo” hookline of the traditional carol. Wonderful voices (Magill/ Elmer), wonderful trumpets.&lt;img class=”alignleft” src=”http://nethymnal.org/img/a/d/o/Adoration%20of%20the%20Shepherds,%20Jacob%20Jordaens%20(1593-1678).jpg”Second is Telafonica songstress Eliza Magill. Her version of “Joy to the World” is far more traditional, but nonetheless skilful and beautiful. In duet with the male vocals (Adrian Elmer), the whole version sounds like a light-hearted version of Low (who must be names when it comes to Christmas carols of course). Fully acoustic, intimate recording, a heartbreaker.&lt;img class=”alignleft” src=”http://washingtonmo.com/christmas/images/1038b.jpg”The Lessons in Time hails from New South Wales and deliver the lopsided part of this compilation. Pretentious on first listen, a revelation at repeated performance! Blake Wassell, the lad behind the moniker, delivers an emotional lo-fi version of “O Holy Night” and raises the hymnal potential of the original to higher power. The Australian Liger? Oh, he plays in Telafonica as well!Eventually, Telafonica join for a last hymnal. “Good News (Sing for Joy)” I wasn’t able to identify properly, but who cares?

Ulmar’s approach to music is fully electronic, XYDZO is not about going back to the essentials, restoration or whatever. While listening to “Y” the reference that came to me repeatedly was “My Life in Bush of Ghosts” by Eno &amp; Byrne.Back in 1981, Ambient music pioneer Brian Eno and Talking Heads frontman David Byrne hooked up to create a artificial documentation of tribal music, ethnic field-recordings and Avantgarde Pop. Ljekio Ulmar adopts a similar position. He takes elements from Russian and African Folklore, popular and electronic music and glues it together to something new and exiting. This is wonderfully successful due to his substantial understanding of Pop music and music in general (is the title “Y” itself a meta-reference to the Pop Group’s abrasive debut from 1979?).The album is full of hits. Some will convince on first touch, for some you might need more time. But every single tune features a fresh idea and makes sense in the dramaturgy of the album. Essential listen!

Betty, infamous for being queer fellow tip to toe, can’t get enough of it. Music that hits you like a physical blow. Bam!No Snow - “zdb” (MP3)No Snow is Lyon duo Gael Moissonier and François Virot, the later who was reviewed for his delightful split release with Karaocake and Marie Marie Cells a few weeks ago. However, to get an idea about the Snow music the Virot-link doesn’t help an inch. After some self-distributed CDr on Moissonier’s Zero Jardins imprint and two compilation appearances, No Snow hooked up with Portuguese Merzbau Netlabel for an untitled one-track EP. This single 22-minutes song “ZDB” feels like being displaced from a bunch of savages, hidden in their wet dark cave, tortured by tribal drums and subsonic waves of bassguitar.No Snow are a performance band and obviously not interested in writing songs. Rather Art Brut than Popmusic. They embrace the noise and chance of a live improvisation, distilling their very special Bat Cave aesthetics. On the one hand, there’s a clear early 80’s No Wave/ Post Punk influence. On the other, No Snow work in the tradition of recent visionaries like Black Dice or the Animal Collective.

And although the label puts information online only in Cyrillic script, this record grabbed my attention immediately. Japanese Akira hails from Tokyo and delivers wonderfully calm Electronica and Guitar-based Ambient on his “Lycoris Radiata” album.Imachi Akira - “Noise Dreams” (MP3)Imachi Akira - “Untitled” (MP3)“Lycoris Radiata” is wonderfully diversified! The album kicks in with the ambient “Noise Dreams”. The tracks sounds rather dreamful than noisy and charmed away my misgivings that Imachi Akira is just another Netaudio Noise-musician. “Birdpia” afterwards entangles Electronica, gentle guitar-chords and field recordings. Alone, the mix is a bit awkward with the clicks n’ cuts quite prominent (which is true for some of the tracks and the only major drawback.At “Aware Si Mono”, Akira pulls out the echo chamber, mixing warm noises with harmonica and his guitar pickings.  The title track “Lycoris Radiata” surprises with massive guitar feedback and distortion noises, while “Silent Way” just afterwards shows the way back to Dub and Jazzy soundscapes. Double bass and piano work superb.  “…” is the last track on the album and with it’s introspect Folk-motives, all these little noises and lo-fi atmosphere it reminds me of Rain Netlabel or, more explicit, Daisuke Miyatani or Beddoes (from whom you will hear somewhat later).Central to Imachi Akira’s album is the twelve-minutes “Untitled”. On top the murmur of a streamlet, a very simple synth bubble is heard. Minute by minute, additional layers of synth loops are introduced. With increasing complexity, motives form in-between what is really played. That recalls Steve Reich’s early works or Philip Glass indeed, but Akira keeps it down to earth by hitting-in a powerful piano track at halftime. The epic ending is noise, and then, the silent creek again.

I guess this is Bypass, the only Chinese label I know at least. Their catalogue number 16 comes from US American Phillip Wilkerson, whose minimal Ambient makes me think of German Electronica… and so the wheel came full circle.Phillip Wilkerson - “Incident 4” (MP3)According to his website, Wilkerson is a busy man. He has a good cue of releases with the usual candidates for experimental Ambient/ Drone stuff (Clinical Archives, Treetrunk, JNN). I do not consider myself an expert in his oeuvre, but Wilkerson’s EP “Incidents in Spring” makes me speculate to become one.Phillip Wilkerson shifts harmonious layers of processed textures, each rich in tone and design. His sound is artificial and glitchy, still Wilkerson manages to  enshrine the warmth of his source material. While the first two compositions are plain Ambient or Drone, tracks three and four come off with songwriting qualities. Rural beats, transparent instruments (if you dare to call that cheapo GM piano in  “Incident 4” an instrument) at interfering micro-melodies make me think of German Electronica like To Rococo Rot or Kreidler.

Highly recommend among these: Belgrade Rock experimentalist Wo0.Wo0 - “Sunkissed Ladymoon” (MP3)Wo0, founding member of the Belgrade Noise Society, has an interesting approach to “play” his guitar. He uses the pickups of his instrument to receive certain frequencies (from cell phones, radio transmitters, and similar).  Processed by multiple effect pedals and amplified to Rock n’ Roll volume, mesmerizing drones emerge that are carefully interlaced and focused in an all-live setup by Wo0. The outcome sounds familiar yet fresh and disturbing.&lt;img class=”size-full wp-image-1074” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/wo0_live.jpg”Warm distortion, rich of overtones, harmonious feedback that underlines Wo0’s drones like Möbius strips, you might want to name the experimental moments of Sonic Youth or Montreal’s GYBE! for reference.

Koen Park is the IDM moniker of Ian Hawgood, a guy featured a lot at Phlow Mag and whose name you probably heard already. While I like his solo works better, Koen Park’s tiny “84’ 85’” EP is an instant hit. Semi-nostalgic Electronica with strong melodies and crisp production.“84’ 85’” by Koen Park was released in two limited 3”-CDR editions over at October Man Recordings (first green than gold, this version is burgundy I guess). I was happy to get hold of the first edition and been listening to the six tracks a lot since then.In a way, it’s nothing special. Fans of IDM will  recognize the heavy Boards of Canada- and early Autechre-influences straightaway. Throw in crunchy Hip Hop beats, fumes of field-recordings plus melancholy melodies and you’ve got it. But the one thing you can’t imitate is musical craftsmanship. And as much as “84’ 85’” isn’t pushing genre borders, it is a wonderful, inspiring piece of music. The EP runs only 18 minutes. But maybe this briefness has a hand in brilliance. Warm, catchy, dense. Awesome when a re-release makes sense.",

The US Liger?Infant Color - “Arms and Bears” (MP3)Infant Color - “Needs” (MP3)I’m writing a lot about Beat is Murder but be assured- it’s only for the sake of music. The latest addition on the Netaudio-branch of the label is Infant Color, a mysterious guy from the South of North America according to his Myspace-account. The label, as usual, doesn’t dare to post any helpful information. The Infant music, however, does not sound a lot like Texas.Infant Color combines drum-machine grooves and cheapo synthpads with his vulnerable singing voice and guitar. Everything mixes quite rough and the whole EP sounds rather awkward than iced. Which is cool- the music and especially Color’s dedicated vocal performance might have turn pretentious otherwise. The old Depeche Mode are an influence for sure, but Infant Color took Electropop to the cleaners and boiled it down to its very essentials.A gold-mine of unspent melodies.

With four self-published records and a lot of tourring through Europe, the US and Canada in the back, Chambon comes off quite professional. Her loose lo-fi Pop miniatures don’t do fortunately. Charming introspect home recordings, and a beautiful voice.Marie Marie Cells hit the spot more rude. Rumbling bass meets juvenile male vocals meets lurching keys that sound like 90’s Shoegaze. A strange combination, but somehow this cheeky Paris boygroup has a knack as well.François Virot finally delights us with two high quality outtakes from his recent “Yes or No” album. In brutal falsetto, only acompanied by his acoustic guitar, Virot performs his awkward Indiepop.

He appeared on Hippocamp, Nexsound, 12rec. and is friends to the guys at Luvsound.Eric Schoster produced and recorded the follow-up to his 2004 debut with a bunch of friends and family, among these Sebastian Kruger of Inlets and Kevin Gipson aka allthatfall.

Fine guests, all together, and they make “Middlemarch” a fine record./images/hecacjog_feature_front.jpg”Eric transforms the warmth and richness of analogue instruments into splintered collages of electronic music. One part of his music is highly processed textures, another other part is low-key melodies and hypnotic rhythms. “Suite Part Four” opens the album with a krauty Poptune that shines forth with a sparkling synth motive. Melancholia and interlaced percussive elements prove central to the He Can Jog sound. “Suite Part Three”  is a bit closer to what you might call a “song”. Mellow stage piano chords mix with Prefuse 73 style beats… super!&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-978” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/hecanjog_banner.jpg”You could mention Four Tet or Cluster for comparison, I can hear a lot of adcBicycle in his music as well. Eric oscillates from crackling Ambient (“Agnes”) to IDM- and Hip Hop influenced Electronica without loosing his special cut-up sound. “Pan-Friend Fern” for instance is an absolute stunning mixture of abstract Hip Hop beats and textural Ambient, while  “Contractors and Architects” (as featured on “Fall is for Lovers”) is a comparatively straight-forward Popsong. Sanborn’s vocals are bewitching. He Can Jog kisses us goodbye with the spirally and mesmerizing “Suite Part One and Two”.How to win d’em damn fine CDs?!?You want to win one of those rare CDs?

Everyone who likes bands such as Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, Isis and Mono, will love Sleepmakeswaves and their re-released EP “In Today already Walks Tomorrow”, where Ambient meets Progressive Rock with a well adjusted dose of musical endorphin.Sleepmakeswaves - “One Day You Will Teach Me To Let Go Of My Fears” (MP3)Sleepmakeswaves - “So That The Children Will Always Shout Her Name” (MP3)The EP kicks off with “I Will Write Peace On Your Wings And You Will Fly Over The World” - a 7:22 minutes long track that kicks off hard to slow down and build up again. Some parts of the song can even be associated with a metal-like style.“Exits To Nowhere” brings you down again and gives you some time to prepare for “One Day You Will Teach Me To Let Go Of My Fears”, which is the strongest and most beautiful track on their EP.After a pretty calm and “minimal” introduction, that only features some ambient background sounds and two guitars, the song develops a fascinating middle-part from 1:30 to 4:10. As soon as the distorted guitars, the strings and the drums set in, the song takes you over. Completely. This is one of the best postrock-pieces I have heard in a long time. Open up for it and it will take you over, too. But listen to it loudly!After this musical highlight it is quite difficult to keep up the beauty and brilliance of “One Day You Will Teach Me…” but still, “In Today Already Walks Tomorrow” in a whole has the power to grab you and hold you close enough to make you stay with it.The subtle electronic variations, the well placed eruptions and the perfectly arranged build-ups create something that deserves a bigger attention to this australian quartet.

Twinkling and fathomless like the Canadian night skies.Kalte - “Spagyric” (MP3)Kalte - “Mariana Arc” (MP3)For their releases, Stasisfield create highly processed images playing with the effects of extrem enlargement, blur and digital halftoning.

Same is for the music.Fully synthetic, enhanced with a little bit of scraping noises, Kalte music is quite kalt (which is “cold” in German).

March Rosetta is the alter ego of UK-born Berlin-living Tom Carter. “Late in Time” is his third album under this moniker, and it is online via the Russian Clinical Archives Netlabel. March Rosetta is all about Tom’s precious vocals and his artful, semi-electronic Popsongs.[March Rosetta - “Landscape”(MP3)](http://www.archive.org/ (MP3)/ca186_mr/01_Landscape.mp3)March Rosetta - “Far Across The Land” (MP3)I think everybody will agree that all-rounder Tom Carter has a wonderful voice. When it comes to the instrumentals, people could argue about the cheapo 80’s drum sound and some kitchy textures. But who cares about such details when the songs come off in such sublime perfection?Carter borrows a lot from David Byrne (Talking Heads, for performance and sexappeal) and Mark Hollis (Talk Talk, the fragility) but shines in unmistakeable uniqueness. Sweet and gooey, kitchy, intimate and touching, funky here and there, Tom Carter manages to balance all these references for maximum effect. Hot Chip might serve as an accurate, more contemporary comparison. Two or three songs in the later half drop off a bit with their easy-listening flavour and an unsavoury Garage-influence.

Then he discovere……Hip Hop, a pencil and his voice to write poems and ryhmes. With “Born in the Land of a Thousand Hills” Mishoo The Drumkit presents us today a small documentary of  his path till today. And I must say, I like his smooth way to rap in a deep relaxed voice. Still very American he doesn’t bores us with stupid Glamour-Glitter-Shit. No, furtunately he focuses and tells us his story. An intelligent way to introduce yourself as a musician.Also I like leaning back on the exquisite beats. Smooth rhode sounds shimmer while Comfort Fit, DJ Madsen and Elaquent with his killer opening-track roll us a fantastic spliff. Seven tracks fitting together perfectly.

            "content": "With their fifth release of the “Intelligent-Toys”-Series Sutemos and Walkman the guys behind Sutemos.net present once again a beautiful and huge compilation of music around IDM, Ambient and sweet Electronica. The Lithunian musiclovers managed once again to represent their collective and extraordinary artists from abroad.Find out how they convinced artists like Vladislav Delay to join their mission »Sutemos is quite around some time now in the world of netlabelism, creative commons and netaudio. How did it all start and who are the main characters behind Sutemos?There are only two of us behind all this - Sutemos and Walkman. We don’t want to steal the glory from other people - there were a lot of them who helped us all through the way, but only two of us remained constantly on this Project (if ir might be called so).It all started out of love for electronic music. Nobody knew it back in 2000 in Lithuania, so we felt that we should promote and share it. It all started with reviews, news and articles. Then we started the English version of the website and the netlabel came in only few years later.What impresses me much is that you delivered extraordinary artwork along with your music releases. It seems that you are some sort of collective. Do you come all from the same city? Do you work together? How close are your bonds and why do you present these artworks together with your music?The story behind the artworks is pretty simple - most of them are done by the people we know. We just happen to take part in a pretty cool community of local artists and they tend to like what we do. Nowadays it also turns to be a good platform for promotion as well for artists which join us from all over the country and even from abroad. There are also some cases when a certain artwork is a wish of the artist (i.e. 3tronik, FusedMarc) and they already have somebody to complete it. We don’t really mind that as long as we like the result ourselves.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1032” title=”sutemos-interview-it-5-4” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/sutemos-interview-it-5-4.jpg”When I have a look on the stunning art of the “Intelligent Toys”-Series I have the feeling, that this art is very much influenced by Eastern Europe artists. Do you agree and if so, by whom are your visual artists influenced?This is partly true. Especially with Intellinget Toys 2. Back in time we felt that some Russian electronic music does not receive enough attention so we decided to fix that. And now we just like what the guys do. But we don’t really mind the nationality.How did you manage to convince known artists like Vladislav Delay, AGF or Ulrich** Schnauss to join your mission and to present their music productions for free?**Well, it’s always about luck. It’s really nice to know that a lot of artists already know what “Intelligent Toys” is.We also already met some of the artists and they know what we do and why we do it.  “Intelligent Toys” are not about the money it’s about exposure to the music. I guess that implies some of the musicians.Some of them just like to try out releasing on a netlabel.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1034” title=”sutemos-interview-it-5-2” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/sutemos-interview-it-5-2.jpg”Together with the above mentioned artists a lot of the other artists come - I guess- from your collective. What do you think makes the Sutemos sound special and different from other releases?Sutemos.net was always about the stuff we like - we wrote news about the artists we love, we reviewed their albums (that’s what most of them received high grades) we interviewed them and we always released only the music we like. We have done lots of work since then and now it pays off. Sounding special is just a matter of our subjective musical taste. Nothing more.What is the story in the video clip? Which language is it and what does the singer sings?If you are asking about “O Nei” music video there’s some story beneath it.Walkman’s girlfriend no_joy was studying animation some years ago and since she really loved this track she chose to make a music video for it as her final bachelor exam. Most of it is hand drawn and animated in Flash. It took about couple of months to make it. Walkman also did some editing/post production on it .I don’t really know the story behind the track itself (you have to ask Sleepy Town Manufacture about that) I just heard that the singer was in France and send STM the files with the vocal over the internet. And it is in Russian language (“O nei” means “about her”)&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-1035” title=”sutemos-interview-it-5-3” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/sutemos-interview-it-5-3.jpg”What can we expect from Sutemos in the future?We always have a lot of plans, but not all of them turn to be real. For now I can say that there will definitely be Intelligent Toys 6 (it’s going to be really massive!), new album of stockfinster and some other stuff, but we will leave the joy of discover for the readersThank you very much for the interview!Phlow Rox!Review and Video of the New CompilationAnd now, dear reader, check out and download the compilation “Intelligent Toys 5” or have a look on the stunning music video from Sutemos.",

Four years and 28 releases later “Octopus Two” offers a musical summary of what Fresh Poulp is about. Guests and members of the Fresh Poulp family present various genres and styles like Dub, Electronica, Chiptune, Breakcore and HipHop. A Fresh Poulp odyssey. Just like Fresh Poulps debut-release “Octopus One”, the second part of the Octopus Compilation gathers two sides.On Side A “Guests” you can find tracks by guest artists, label’s friends or some casual collaborators. Some of the pieces might give us an idea of future Fresh Poulp artists. 26 year old Cyril Guillory for example, who is also known as Aquilone (he has already put out an album at muertepop). His Electronica-Shoegazer-Pop sounds very promising and “Chess Wall” is one of the highlights of the “Octopus Two” compilation.Side B, the “Family”-side, gives an overview of artists that have already released some works on Fresh Poulp Records. Pix for example, whose releases have also been mentioned in some 2008 netaudio highlights here at phlow-magazine, contributed a new piece to the compilation. His lovely Electronica-Downtempo-Hiphop mix is allways a good treat. But there are many more Fresh Poulp veterans on “Octopus Two” - pieR, Guitoud and Yarkouy for example, who present their distinct electronica-dub styles.So, there is a lot to look forward to in 2009.

Now we want to do it again with other magazines, with your help!Before I sent the little promo-package to c’t magazine, I asked them if they would like to receive a “gift”. Fortunately I knew one of the editors of c’t magazin, because I write for them about web technologies from time to time. With this little extra credit, I got the chance and some more attention than usually. And even though the editor didn’t dig our music style so much, he wrote a nice review about us empasizing the interesting creative commons music culture. The review wasn’t only printed in the magazine itself, you can read the german review also online.Afterwards a lot of my friends congratulated me, that Phlow-Magazine.com made it into a print magazine. I was amazed, that still so many people read link tips. One of my girl friends saWhere you can help us!Of course, there are several ways to support the magazine to reach new readers. You can write a review on Stumble Upon or bookmark our articles on websites like Delicious.com or Mister Wong… But to reach new reader- and listenerships for your netlabel or blog you have to make good promotion not only on the web. And that’s the point, where you come in!I would like to send some more promotion material to magazines worldwide to get more attention for the artists, netlabels and of course Phlow-Magazine.com. Do you know interesting magazines who write also reviews about websites? I am thinking for example about magazines for instruments like the german Keys, keyboards or Beat.Unfortunately music magazines in general in Germany don’t write about netlabels and free music at all. A horrible desaster, if you ask me. That’s why I want to twist it into the other way.Can you name me some really interesting computer-, live style- or similiar magazines you like to read and think they are worth some promo material?And while we talk about promotion: If you have some stickers or buttons left, sent them to M.

I wrote a review for his 2007’s Autoplate release short before the label vanished, but there are recent releases at IOD, Zymogen and Resting Bell Netlabel who would have been worth a feature as well. Alone in 2008, Jason had two CDs released.offthesky - “Swallow Shallows” (MP3)offthesky - “Symphony for Exiting Entropies” (MP3)Jason Corder’s Ambient music rises from the ashes of a thousand instruments like fume from a wasted fireplace. It escapes the crashed corpora of violins, guitars and chimes. It’s fluid and ghostlike, drifts from here to there, but once it had entered your ears, you can’t get it out of your head. His tickeling textures swarm with micro-tonalities and bring forth that wonderful richness offthesky can be recognised by in all his releases.In a way, Corder appears like someone who rather captures sound, more like a scientist who knows where to point the microscope to to reveal the beauty of the unseen. For a music video, I’d put someone catching insects with a butterfly net on a late Summer hayfield. In slow motion and back light. Humble beauty! Listen to “Swallow Shallow” and join my praise.

Somehow I got the impression Dsum likes Thomas Fehlmann and his extraordinary TechHouse-Tunes…Especially the sweet “Liberdad (Original Mix)” track floats with its analogue jazz bassline like the setting sun into the sea. Easy, man! If you like it a little bit darker, check out the remix by Rat with some playful clickering percussions for a deeper TechHouse-approach.If you hop over to the compilation, you discover some deeper house tunes like “Sublime” and more airy and classic dubtechno tunes like “Bermuda”.  “Colores: Fluidos” fits perfect to sunny afternoons sitting around with friends eager to start into a fun club night.MP3 House Music DownloadDownload: Dsum - “Libertad EP” (ZIP-Archive) // “Colores: Fluidos” (ZIP-Archive)**Release:** Dsum “Libertad EP” and Various “Colores: Fluidos”Netlabel: Monofónicos Netlabel",

His label Ground Floor is rather tight-liped about their artist, so we’re thrown back to the music itself. Not too bad after all. Son Of A Bricklayer produces dark and experimental Hip Hop tunes, instrumental, with a lot of musicality and a mind for history.Czech Netlabel Ground Floor Records is active since 2005. How come I never heard of them? Their style is pretty dark, Death Hop, a mixture from Punk, Industrial and Gothic imagery which is prominently featured by artists like Dälek, Necro or Aesop Rock. Not what you would expect from a Hip Hop label but quite well done- label head noizcut is responsible for the design of the website and all Ground Floor releases.Consequently, the artwork for Son Of A Bricklayer’s “Shades Of Grey” LP is bleak and dirty as well. And although his music is not exactly uplifting and colourful, I was surprised to find relaxed and jazzy end-90s Hip Hop tunes rather than noisy break beats. Experimental in parts ( “Man Hunt”, “Bolga”) but mostly very well crafted instrumentals that sound like rainy streets at night, long car rides and  New York City in general. The instant hits are “One”, “Bloom” or “La Chambre”. Son Of A Bricklayer sounds like SixToo, Shadow and the early RJD2 and did an awesome job on “Shades Of Grey”.

That was some years back in time, when he started publishing his minimal techno as Hermético on a homelabel named Doblec. Later he founded inoQuo.com with Sr.Click and Dato, which is, without any doubt,  one of the BIG spanish netlabels. You should check it out now and then if you’re into minimal beats. Jaume also started a netaudio blog called Oir Para Creer some years ago and releases experimental dark ambient music under his Nigul alias. You can also find some of his jobs under the nickname Choplin.

But during my talks to musicians, to radio broadcasters and people who listen to music, there was always one response: curiosity and enthusiastic reactions. So, one is for sure: free music is more and more becoming a true alternative to get attention, concerts and dj-gigs. So keep it up, and deliver me some more of those fantastic breaks, beats and grooves!

I got the chance to get some money and promotion for Pirata, Apes on Tapes, le mépris, Ambidextrous and Morkva, The Incognito Traveller and The Raincoated Man. Thumbs up!Barcelona, London, Cologne…In late summer and autumn than, two highlights appeared. First I visited Barcelona and the gentle people from Netaudio.es. Thank you for inviting me to Spain!And in october I flew to Netaudio London with the crazy people from 12rec Netlabel. Yeah, I am talking about Sim Sullen and Sven Swift - our dedicated Netaudio lover. We enjoyed our deep trip into the jungle of London. Thank you, Andi, Chris, Dimitris, Hanna, Jon, Matt and Nina X for inviting us!Last not least it was the music, which made me drift away and all those discoveries I made.

Who will you pay attention to?But stop! Before you leave the room in panic, give Thiaz Itch a chance. Explore his instrumental tracks, listen to his songs where he sings like “The Gardener’s Lament” or “B Line”.  And get convinced by his original instrumentation, his happy, funky music with lots of twists and weird surprises.Truely individual and sometimes hard to take!

He released his first EP “Tonight It Shows” via Aerotone and it soon became one of the Netlabel’s most successful records. Naturally, hopes for the successor were high. While the ingredients are roughly the same, “On A Hill Not Far Away” beats the debut with ease.The first Cantaloup EP never really got me. The sound was right, all the ideas were there. But somehow Thomas Peters didn’t manage to make his melodies stick and consequently buried them in reverb. For “On A Hill Not Far Away” , Peters cleaned up sound and songwriting a lot. The reverb is still there but guitars and especially Eva Paul’s vocals don’t drown within it anymore. The music cleaned up so well that I thought about getting some beginner guitar lessons at Takelessons.com so I could play some of Peter’s music.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-853” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/cantaloup.jpg”The sentiment changes from lovely to lugubrious, and i like the lovely songs better. The first half of the album is formidable without a doubt, most notably “When My Girl Walks Through This Garden”.  The eight minute “Crooked Rain” (with buddy Hoodwink) at the end is worth a mention as well (I was excepting a Pavement cover version!). More experimental, closer to his old Postrock band Item maybe, with a impulsive bass guitar, moog flutes and chimes, this tune makes me impatiently await Cantaloup’s next moves.

            "content": "Vienna’s Most Wonderful Popband // Dino Spiluttini, the blond beau behind the Liger moniker, asked me to review his “The Infra-Ordinary EP” back in 2005. The EP was a cute little gem of a Netaudio release, filled with fragile, eccentric and electrified Folk songs. Three years later not much has changed- despite the fact that “Crash Symbols” became such a wonderful revelation.Well- talking about sound, “Crash Symbols” is far apart from the lo-fi Folk of “The Infra-Ordinary EP” and the follow-up split EP with A Thousand Fuegos. Carefully mixed and mastered, every instrument is in place, filling the room, filling your head. Central to the Liger muzak now and then: Dino Spiluttini’s trembling bass-baritone, full of strength and failure, sex and melody.Every now and then, the music menaces to collapse like a house of carts under a dozen of instruments and the band’s emotional ingenuousness. But Dino holds tight the strings of his compositions, supported by former live drummer Prince Gernot Scheithauer XIII. (left) of Mimi Secue-fame as a distinct band  member for the first time. On some tracks Liger are joined by label mates Br’er, the Dust Covered Carpets and famous friends like Trouble of Tokyo or Gustav.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-831” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/ligerboyz.jpg”Liger shifted from their “Post Folk” implosions to a sound more Pop. You might want to name Xiu Xiu and Final Fantasy for comparison, maybe Patrick Wolf, that’s fair. But Dino and Gernot sound unique, brighten their ideas of (Avantgarde) Pop with chamber musical instrumentation and burst of Rock energy that come fresh and raw. In a way, Liger sounds very Vienna. **What makes “Crash Symbols” outstanding in spite of everything is Dino’s talent to write touching melodies. Hop over to last.fm and listen to “Split Yourself Lilith”, “All Caps” or “You Are An Engineer Too”. On the album, there is much more awesomeness to find.

Dids awesome catchy and funky electronic rock is full of surprises and probably makes you wonder when you think about their hometown of Turin, Italy.

But here they are, 4 young boys from Italy, rocking the dancefloor with the feel of beeing trapped in the best of the eightees with a modern touch of electronic rock. Did are Guido Savini, Giancarlo Maresca, Andrea Tirone and Andrea Prato from the Motor-City of Turin, which is known for its car factories and network of highways. Maybe this has something to do with their music. Because Dids sound buzzes like a good running engine. Never stopping beats, the baseline goes on without hesitation, guitars are mashing up the scene and electronic elements are everywhere adding this little bit of extra extra. “Ask U2” seems to be a forerunner for their upcoming album that will invade our dancefloors hopefully very soon.Placed in “The Dancy Issue” in the back-catalogue of the italien netlabel Kirstens Postcard, Dids “Ask U2” EP is surely something that will find it’s way all around the world.

            "content": "Visiting Hidden Corners of the Global Netlabel Phenomena // While internet data highways connect more and more countries and cultures all over the world, the distribution of music speeds up and we get access to places we’ve never been. Places like Indonesia where cassettes are still a commonly used medium to listen to music next to CDs and MP3s. Indonesia where netlabelism is still a tiny growing plant but where the idea of Creative Commons fall with its seeds on a rich ground. Welcome to the world wide web and the first netlabel from Indonesia: Yes No Wave Music.The head behind the Indonesian netlabe called Yes No Wave Music is Wok The Rock. As a visual artist he lives and works in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The 33 years old loves music since his 8th birthday and released his first album when he was 16. In the old days he used an old tape recorder for his first release.Wok The Rock was involved in the punk scene 1996, writing and publishing a zine, formed a label which focused on punk music, built a web-based punk community and organized some underground music gigs. In 2002 he began forming and organizing Ruang MES 56, an artists initiative space focused on contemporary photography. In 2007 he started Yes No Wave Music by himself with the help of Bagus Jalang who writes the liner notes for each release. For a living he does web and graphic design.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-844” title=”king-django” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/king-django.jpg”  Running the first netlabel in Indonesia: Wok The Rock  For Germans, Indonesia is far away. I have no clue how easy or difficult it is to release music in Indonesia. So tell us! Are there \"normal\" labels, are there \"netlabels\" and how do people in Indonesia get their music?Indonesia which has the biggest music industry in South-East Asia, exports its music production to nearby countries like Singapore, Malaysia and even Japan. Unlike mainstream music industry, Indonesian underground music has more various and progressive genres from indiepop to drum n’ bass, dub, post rock, math rock and experimental jazz which has a good fan base in many countries. One of Indonesias most popular electro pop bands, Goodnight Electric, was invited by Goethe-Institut to perform on c/o pop Festival in Cologne, Germany.It’s not hard to release a record in Indonesia. In some big cities in Indonesia, there are lots of unexpensive record studios. For your information, cassette is still popular to be used. The cost for cassette duplication is very affordable for bands with not-so-much money. The cost for cover sleeves are also cheap.But when the internet became popular, the selling of casssettes and CDs decreased. Pirated CDs are a horible monster for Indonesias music industry. In every corner of the city, pirated audio CDs, MP3 (CD Data), and DVD Movies are affordable and easy to find. Torrent, Rapidshare and other blogs which provided songs in illegal MP3 format are very common for a lot of teenage music fans.But, although while they are very common with torrent or other file sharing systems and there is a zine that writes reviews about some netlabel releases around the world, teenage music fans still are unfamiliar with netlabels. Yes No Wave Music is the first netlabel in Indonesia and started in April 2007.  When and why did you choose do release music under creative commons licences in Indonesia?The DIY (Do It Yourself) ethics and the distribution of pirate material are the main reason for me to run this netlabel. To release free music together with a digital license is the logic consequence to deal with the current conditions. To get more profit, the selling of band merchandise has became more effective than the selling of CDs or cassettes. Through a netlabel, bands can easily distribute their songs more widely. With more people listening, this will impact the selling of the bands merchandise and the chance to get a gig.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-846” title=”yesnowavemusic-small-scr” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/yesnowavemusic-small-scr.jpg”  Click to open huge screenshot of Yes No Wave Music Website (ca. 1 MB)  Have many people in Indonesia access to the internet? And how is the response to your music?Internet is very popular in Indonesia. In many big cities there are lots of places, like campus, cafés, artspaces, that provided a free Wi-Fi-access to the web. Almost every office has an internet access. In Yogyakarta, where I’ve lived, affordable internet cafés can be found everywhere.After six months, Yes No Wave Music gets lots of attention from the music scene. Some of the national media interviewed me and wrote articles about my label and the netlabel. One of the media was the Indonesian Rolling Stone Magazine. They also noted Yes No Wave Music in an article about record labels and the music industry in Indonesia.The Upstairs is the first mainstream band who released their music on Yes No Wave Music. Yes No Wave Music also became the label of the month in Dogmazic, a netlabel portal from France.  Who releases on your netlabel? Do you focus only on musicians from Indonesia?&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-848” title=”yesnowavemusic2” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/yesnowavemusic2.jpg”Yes No Wave Music never had a limitation to a certain music genre. We also get in touch with any band, either mainstream or underground, as long as we love the music and the musicians are unique and interesting characters. We also aren’t limited to any country, race or nation. One of our release, Very Expensive Porno Movie, came from Croatia. Of course, music from Indonesia provides the biggest portion because the promotion of Indonesian music to an international audience is one of our aims.  What are your three favorite releases on Yes No Wave Music and why?  **[yesno013] “Music Beyond No Borders Vol. 2”**  “This compilation shows the various genre of music in Indonesia.”  **[yesno005] Zoo “Kebun Binatang”**  “Zoo is my favourite math-noise rock band.”  **[yesno008] Shorthand Phonetics “Apparently…I’m In Medicine / Love, or the Illusion of the Beginning Symptoms of It”**  “This is a one-man band, a bedroom musician who didn’t play digital/electronic music and had been released all his good-and-clever-lyrics songs through The Internet Archive since 2003. This is a very rare ways in Indonesia. Our encounter was like adam and ever!”** **  Links to Yes No Wave Music**Netlabel: [www.yesnowave.com](http://www.yesnowave.com/) See also: http://demotape.yesnowave.com**",

Remembering the good ole days might be a stupid reason to fancy certain songs or bands but sometimes you can’t help. Consider New York City Famicom-Rockers The Depreciation Guild - what took these delicious guys to fuse early 90’s Shoegaze with tickling 8bit textures? You simple don’t have another opportunity than lovin’ them!Three American guys with surprisingly German names, Kurt Feldman with brothers Anton and Christoph Hochheim form a band of two guitars, vocals and a modified Famicom, known as “NES” in Europe (check this nice techtalk article to learn more about their line up).The Depreciation Guild’s first EP “Nautilus” was released over at 8bitpeoples.com (see our Blip feature for a nice live video of the band at the 2007 festival), but their full-length album is online on their website without any label support. This makes sense in a way as their melody-driven Indierock never suited the Peoples that well.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-783” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/tdg03.jpg”Recorded by Feldman and his companion Akira Hashizume, “In Her Gentle Jaws” (what a title!) features ten energetic and moony Pop tunes with a lot of fuzzy guitars and vocals like recorded in a hall church. The Famicom leads are integral part of their music and not only used as a gimmick. Slightly out of tune, most of their songs don’t show up with all of their bliss at first try, but “Sky Ghosts”, “Dark Looming” or “Digital Solace” are bittersweet symphonies par excellence.A light-hearted version of My Bloody Valentine, Ride, Cocteau Twins of course… imagine this bands mixed with the sound of Nintendo’s oldest console and you know what The Depreciation Guild sound like.

A good descriptions for the music, indeed! Between Dada lyrics, lo-fi Pop and Plunderpunk, one man outfit Dublin Duck Dispensary populate his own cosy niche.One thing I like a lot about demos, b-side compilations, live recordings, and, well, certain Netaudio releases is the fact that the music can be quite rough. Unhewn both in sound and songwriting, Dublin Duck Dispensary’s  “Luanqibazao” is a good example for what pearls might easily be overseen upon flighty observation. 13 tracks and drafts for Popsongs to come, much excitement can be found in here.“Bible Stories” is the demo version of an early Arcade Fire tune, “Prestidigitation” features lopsided drums and a happy-sad synth melody that makes you think of Nicholas Thorburn’s Unicorns (a big guide very likely!). “I Smell The Blood” is a wonderful guitar-driven Popsong, “Brain Damage” a Wire-style assault of compressed Punk energy. Between a few dubby experiments, “The Death Threat” is another fine Indiepop song you might want to be familiar with. Did I mention the Beta Band for comparison? Stephen Malkmus? Bobby Aherne’s influences are legion, but alltogether he manages to make to sound fresh and unique.Check this delicate live performance!MP3 Pop Music DownloadDownload: “Luanqibazao” ZIPRelease: Dublin Duck Dispensary - “Luanqibazao”Netlabel: www.rackandruinrecords.comArtist-Website: **www.myspace.com/dublindd**",

Russia’s grand master of audio collage, Alex Lisovsky a.k.a. Djet is back with his latest album of luscious deep ambience wonderfully mashed together with anything from classical music to 80’s electro disco to experimental guitar music. I was a fan of his last album, Nightline, but the progresssion in Livosky’s new release is plain to see.While this is definitely not easy listening, being mostly fairly bleak, and often very intense or harsh, Livosky’s multi-layered compositions truly take you on an emersive journey. The music is at times reminiscent of early Skylab, or the Future Sound of London although Djet’s style is definitely his own. The thing that makes Djet special is his meticulously crafted transitions between often radically different styles of music. Those who appreciate innovation and progressive music should have a listen. Get your headphones, shut your eyes and drink it in.The one thing I would say against the album is that the mood is fairly bleak. Some of the album is a bit too warped and dark for my liking such as “Soap Opera” or “Muddy Muse,” but those who aren’t averse to a bid of the dark-side, will enjoy his creations here.The album is really best listened to in it’s entirety, but if I was to pick out individual tracks, my favourites would be Belledanse, Aloe, Dusty dreams and Southeast waltz.",

            "content": "IDM and Drum’n’Bass from Russia // Human Terminal is a very promising artist from Russia. The silent ways and floating numbers sometimes give me the idea from “Future Sound of London”, but is a somehow different way. The album “Press any Key”, released on Rec72, combines silent moments with some fast-paced IDM’ish Drum’n’Bass on other tracks.Where is all the IDM-music gone? Maybe it went out-of-space, but maybe it found a  new home on the web on netlabel Rec72. Good, what does IDM mean after all? Is it close listening? Is it scaping spheres and fast rhythms, that do not take the borders of music-genres too closely? I hope for the last. Because the EP “Press any Key” does provide both.The first tracks on the EP are somehow like very classic trance-tracks, so music that went its way, before rave-trance was born. A little bit like very classic (British?) tunes of trance music. Please let me crawl into the speaker. The other half of this EP features fast-paced tracks of IDM-music, maybe in the same tradition. Harsh, not precise, also not upfront. Meant to listening. But this is also my critique, at least my personal. Although there is a sure value of the music on this EP I am missing some sort of flow - at least if you take a look in the other half of this EP.I like to drift to the scapes, and also like the disturbing rhythms of Human Teriminal. But what I don’t like is to tell “This track is more like floating and this like weird beats”. The IDMish thing after all (IDM = intelligence dance music?) is about fucking over all genres, in order to make make the people dance or have them a whole experience and after all, isn’t it? Maybe I just didn’t met this dancefloors already yet. Maybe things just have to progress, so please keep up with giving us such tunes!MP3 IDM Music DownloadDownload: Human Terminal - “Press any Key” (ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: human-terminal.blogspot.comRelease: Human Terminal - “Press any Key”Netlabel: www.rec72.net",

He’s the coordinator of Audioactiviste and Insubordinations Netlabels and is involved in 1.000 musical projects. His impressive discography involves releases at Zymogen, Test Tube, eDogm and many more. His most recent EP is delivered by the welcome hands of Resting Bell Netlabel.While some of Laurent Peter’s older recordings have a strong foundation in 1990’s electronica acts like Autechre, Squarepusher and SND, his style slightly shifted in recent years.With “Stase / Contre Stase”, Resting Bell releases a two track EP of post-industrial field music, a one-hour mediation on noise, textures and Collage Ambient, to make use of the term I introduced for Preslav Literary School a few months ago. Two tracks that stand like monoliths, two tracks that sum-up the glitch aesthetics, d’incise stands ultimately for.The awesome thing about “Stase” and “Contre Stase” is that both tracks work equally well as pure sound design and pieces of recycling art as well as virtuoso Ambient music. Beneath tons of field recordings, humming, hissing, scratching and environmental noise, Peter introduces tonal textures and layers of glittering synth drones that makes his deconstructions a hell of a good listen. Music that demands your attention, that forces you to reflect. Take some time and relearn to listen. d’incise is the perfect teacher.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-772” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/dincise_phlow_2.jpg”You can purchase a wonderful CDR edition of “Stase / Contre Stase” by getting in contact with d’incise.

            "content": "Angular and Elegant Techno // Andrey Kiritchenko is the man behind the wheels of Ukrainian Nexsound record label. As a musician, Kiritchenko moved from 1990s electronica to musique concrete and drone music. His recent oeuvre knows about tender Folk tunes and subtle improvisations as well as harsh noise. On “Sinemagiq”, Kiritchenko dedusts our old friend Techno.Well, Techno. What a odd genre, equalizing cheap rave tunes and serious sound science all in the name of the bass drum. Andrey Kiritchenko, as you probably can guess, is rooted far out at the experimental edges of what you know as Techno music. For the self-released “Sinemagiq” EP, he goes for the basic fundaments of electronic dance music: repetition, tribalism, straight but effective melodic minimalism.Seven tunes, arranged like a good DJ set, with a limited set of sound that appear all quite brownish to me- take a look at the awesome cover artwork by Dmytro Nikolaenko to get an idea what I mean. Everything sounds very organic, wooden by chance, and there’s a knarz in there that’s substantially different from the Berlin squarewave Rockers the kids are so mad about these days. Kiritchenkos music is dark, driving and develops a hypnotic pull that’s hard to resists. From the disharmonic siren in “00” to the fat UK-style bass synth in “06”. Highly recommended.MP3 Techno DownloadDownload: [“Sinemagiq” ZIP](http://www.archive.org/download/AndreyKiritchenko-Sinemagiq/AndreyKiritchenko-Sinemagiq_vbr_mp3.zip) Release: Andrey Kiritchenko - “Sinemagiq”**** Artist-Website: www.nexsound.org/akir****",

His oeuvre is confusing, there are remix albums, free stuff, pay-for-download music, collaborations, compilations… well. Bettina got in contact and took the tour de force, listening to everything. Here’s an artists you don’t want to miss.&lt;img class=”alignleft” src=”http://www.tidykid.com/images/Tidy%20Kid%20Debut%20CD%202006.jpg”In 2006, Tidy Kid released the first EP “People Sit In Cars” via his own label Tidy Kid Music. You can stream this six tracks treasure chest on his website or simply buy the limited CD via cdbaby. The musical concept is, roughly spoken, to mix awkward Indiepop with elements of Electronica and Psychedelia. No Indietronics but Pop in capital letters with a grounding of electronic music. Two tracks from this EP are free for download, and these two are wonderful, especially the neo-60’s Pop of “Kommt” (the sequence of the song titles is “Ein Kleines Bein Kommt Zuhause Angehuepft” which means “A Small Leg Comes Jumping at Home”… WTF?). Talking about Tidy’s voice, James McNew of Yo La Tengo and Dump might be a good comparison.&lt;img class=”alignleft” src=”http://www.tidykid.com/images/frozenflowerpot.jpg”EP number two was published by Mexican Umor Rex Netlabel for free download (website down at the moment, back soon!). Tidy Kid enhances the element of melancholia in his music for “My Frozen Flower Pot” and sounds a bit more British than on “People Sit In Cars”… Probably Thom Yorke’s solo output comes to your mind as well. At the same time, Tidy emancipates himself from the slightly naive programming of his older works and expands both into experimentalism and shameless melodies. Tracks “Flower” and “Smell” are awesome.Third is Lüske’s “Fragments EP”. Six tracks and sketches that document the music, Tidy Kid improvised for a piece of performing arts by Nick McGavern in February 2008 in Brisbane, Australia. Kid remixed the tunes, arranged the pieces and published them via Acroplane Netlabel earlier this year. With it’s loose beats, scattered sounds and overall improvisation feel, this one is probably NOT the record to start with- though there are some nice things to find. At least, fragments “2”and “3” are worth the effort.&lt;img class=”alignnone” src=”http://www.tidykid.com/images/visual%20performance%2008/four.jpg”Tidy Kid’s KinderzimmerThere is much more to find on his website.

So… we have to focus on the music!Sergey Misyureff’s debut as To4ka.Dna is an impressive collection of five pieces of dense Ambient music, rich in texture and monochromatically stained in autumn colours; the artwork, as it should, gives you a good idea about the music.“3’34”” starts with guitar feedback, decent cracklings and some simple synthesizers. “Odno Slovo” combines processed strings with a hypnotic bass fundament. Atop, you get to hear several little noise. The tunes rises to epic when a heavily reworked electric guitar comes in: Wow! For the titletrack, Misyureff gets a tiny little closer to Pop harmonies, at the same time expanding borders with field recordings and ambient noise.Another sound artist from East Europe or Russia with a highly unique sound and big talents in songwriting.

            "content": "“A One Man Band With No Fans” // This is what Brad Sucks (Brad Turcotte) says about his music. Well, he is a one man band but he is definitely not with no fans. Since 2001 he releases his music freely on the web and ever since he is using blogs and P2P-technology to spread his works. He can be considered as one of the first fully open source web-based recording artists and he just released his second album “Out of it”. His debut “I don’t know what I’m doing” (2003) was well received in the online community and made him become one of the first “web-musicians” who gained attention beyond the digital world.  “[…] Despite giving my music away for free online, my songs have been licensed for television, played on commercial and campus radio, and I made enough money from licensing and sales to do a real pressing of my first CD […] “ (Brad Turcotte)“I don’t know what I’m doing”, that was often compared to the sound of Beck, led to countless remixes that were featured on ccMixter, a Creative Commons remix-platform. Some of these remixes were put on the album “I Don’t Know What I’m Doing Remixed”.  “I put the source files for my album I Don’t Know What I’m Doing online and people made a lot of remixes. I Don’t Know What I’m Doing Remixed is a compilation of some of my favorites.” (Brad Turcotte)For his new album “Out of it” he allready made source files available and it will surely not take long for new remixes to come up. “Out of it” continues the melodic sound of “I don’t know what I’m doing” but this time Brads indie/alternative rock comes along with stronger beats and even more obvious guitars.Besides his great music, Brad Sucks is one of only a few “web-musicians” who fully adapted the open source licencing model to music. He uses the BY-SA Creative Commons license, that also allows commercial use of his works (Usually netlabels and musicians go for a noncommercial license that restricts commercial use).  “A lot’s changed since I started putting music on the Internet way back in 2001. Artist-endorsed free downloads were shocking. Flexible pricing was still an untested novelty. It was rare to find source files from artists and sharing music wasn’t encouraged by new artists. Recently I was asked if I’d do anything different this time around. Would I still give the music away for free? Would I still give away my source files? Would I still be easygoing about copyright? Surely I could pull back now and try to cash in. And I honestly couldn’t imagine why I’d do things different. The only reason I, a dude who made an album by himself in a country basement, has had any sort of success is because people took it upon themselves to share my music with their friends. They remixed it, they used it in their videos, they played it on their podcasts, they included it in software and games and it took on a life of its own. To sabotage that would be a huge, retarded mistake. Instead I’ll be grateful if Out of It worms around the world in even close to the same freaky way I Don’t Know What I’m Doing did and continues to.” (Brad Turcotte)If you want to know more about Brad, visit his website and listen to this Interview (Podcast), done by the Redhat Magazine.Enough said!

On “You Break My Heart, You Remixed It” the austrialian project Emily In Love meets her remixers. Especially Rupert Falsch from Berlin took the rendez-vous quite serious and starts a duet with Emily to express his gratitude to remix her.While surfing for information about this electropop release, you read:  “Emily In Love is the side project of Emily, one half of the electropop duo Bisexual Cyborg, a sad Australian girl who makes dreamy indiepop/folk/tronica for herself and her imaginary cats.”Corpid Netlabel is quite known for its careful and earnest remixes for its own ladies. Just remember the excellent Bobby Baby-Remixes! This time Lucky Misu, Rupert Falsch and Microholiday got invited by Emily in Love. And, yes they took the rendez-vous serious and did a very nice job. I guess, Emily will invite them for another tête-à-tête soon… Just listen to “Outside to play” and “Lullaby (Rupert Falsch Remix)” and enjoy some playful, melancholic but melodic pop.MP3 Pop Music DownloadDownload: Emily in Love - “You Break My Heart, You Remixed It”(ZIP-Archive)Artist-Website: www.myspace.com/emilyinlovemusicRelease: Emily in Love - “You Break My Heart, You Remixed It”Netlabel: Corpid Netlabel",

It is a small, but a very powerful compilation with music from the label staff.Disasterpease “Ensis” (MP3)Alex Maurer “Ikea Shopper Credits” (MP3)Phlogiston “Crystal Waves” (MP3)There are minimum two pieces on “Heartcode” that are outstanding and blasting away any doubts about the grown-up abilities of chip-musicians. The masterpiece is “Ensis” from Disasterpeace. He likes to combine crazy things with different speeds, surprising breaks, fine melodies - all put together with extraordinary composational abilities. It is really hard to shine next to such a burner.Nevertheless… the other tracks on “Heartcode” are pure 1-a finest quality. “Ikea Shopper Credits” from Alex Maurer brings back the Marble Madness vibe, while tracks like “Monstrox” or “Get Pumped” the complexity and the addicitve sound that you maybe missed since the days of Turrican or old games from Konami.

Monomatik are part of this sampler with their chart-breaking “The One With The Leadguitar”-tune which really got me. The German trio produces clever electronic dance music that borrows a lot from Pop and has an unique “handmade” feel.All six tracks on “But We Made It So Far” are dance music in a way. So what’s special about the Monomen? The three guys from Cologne and Bochum have been around for more than ten years now, with albums and EPs at Ideology since 2005 and a handful of self-released CDs and vinyl. They started as a Drum &amp; Bass act, discovering the sweet ambrosia of Pop music very soon. Since then, Monomatik refined their organic dance music by going into big naive melodies, decently bouncing rhythms and wonderful little sound surprises.For instance, the whistling melodie in “The One Where Everybody Joins In” is funny and charming and makes you listen up. “The One With The Leadguitar” is a must-hear as well. Alongside a fuzzy guitar, the chorus brings up sweet memories of genuine (and strange) German popacts like La Düsseldorf and Trio (sic!). Like these acts, Monomatik don’t take themselves too serious and spice their music with whatever comes along.

That’s why “netBloc Volume 17” comes around with a huge PDF-Booklet including pictures of the artists, interviews with these musicians and at the end a list of links to dig deeper into the world of free music. An extraordinary starting point to get to know the world of free (netlabel) music!A big “Whoo-ha! Re-Re-Wind, selecta!” to blocsonic! Great job! On this compilation you find rock, electronic music and our favorite netlabel-girl Brigitte Bijoux who had the chance to join the collection with one of her tracks. What I like best about this compilation next to its open minded approach on music is the effort Michael Gregoire made to present each of the artists. In the PDF you read interviews next to the biography of each artist/band. In these interviews you find interesting answers from the participating musicians, why they release their music for free and how they did get in contact with the free music movement.It must have been a lot of work to put these information together, so thank you Michael Gregoire for the music and insights!

The melodic song “Complete” is a deep, sweet and slow-motion song with a catchy bleeping title-melody. It’s IDM-Music in its best classic way. So it’s no surprise, that nine musicians were lucky to lay their hands on the release to remix it. The result is a versatile album which explores the original from different corners….I enjoy the idea of remixing. Especially my curiosity gets triggered if musicians remix musicians. Like Kruder &amp; Dorfmeister with their sessions or the remixes done for Björk in the early years between her debut and the homogenic-album… Remixing is art which has to reinvent the original by keeping its true soul alive. Not an easy task if you ask me, and I did remixes myself…Just digg deep into this song called “Complete” and check out the tricky shuffled Bad Comfort Remix or the warm melancholic and slowly drifting remix by Madstyle. Also interesting the Sm Remix using a piano for the melody instead of using bleeps. While the SM Remix transforms “Complete” into a enigmatic anthem only the Illuminated Faces Remix straightens the beats and produced a sensitive 4 to the floor track…MP3 IDM Music DownloadDownload: Modul - “Complete Remixed” (ZIP-Archive)Release: Modul - “Complete Remixed”Netlabel: Phonocake Netlabel",

Rock-orientated Netaudio has become rather usual these days, but this precious lo-fi gem is something special. Brian Wilson-style vocal melodies, jazzy chords on guitars that sound like metal-rimmed glasses and a lot of (North) American Indiepop a la Pavement is what these kids have to offer.America Del Sur (“America of the South”) is basically Phil Cardona and Taylor Ross. Friends from high school days back in Jacksonville, Florida, the band released their self titled debut at Rack &amp; Ruin, a Dutch Netlabel online since early 2008 but with a back catalog of +70 records already.Here, number 64 is the one you definitely need to know. Cardona and Ross manage to mix angst-ridden Indierock (“Evil Pop”) and sophisticated white boy Jazzpop (“I Don’t Know You”) like a duck takes to water. Their drums sound like shit, the guitars are tied just beneath the chin very probably. There is some Surf in there. But just like for recent NYC darlings Vampire Weekend, it’s the fine vocal harmonies that keep the whole thing going- and America Del Sur at heavy rotation in my player.

What joy to see his most recent “Fragments” EP published at Creation Centre!Gabriel Hernandez’ Rain Music Netlabel is a good home for Daisuke Miyatani, but Creation Centre is no less. His loose and lo-fi Folk scribbling suit the ideals of Pop on the one hand and an approach of spontaneity and defectiveness and the other. It’s a shame the EP is so damn short (just about 8 minutes) but following title and liner notes, it makes perfect sense at last:“Daisuke’s pieces are like trying to remember a dream after you wake up. Familar, but quickly fading into the noise of life. Quickly he is here to remind us of our dreams. to enjoy that we even have them to start with.”Miyatani’s music is based around tiny loop-a-like melodies he improvises on his acoustic guitar. Certain field-recordings wash through his compositions, hiss and environmental noise are are important as moments of silence. Sometimes, found sounds work as percussion elements. What I like best about Miyatani is the impressive element calmness and self-absorption of his music. There are similar (Japanese) artists like Kozo Ikendo or  Yuichiro Fujimoto, but Daisuke Miyatani is my favourite.P.S.: Watch out for his new collaboration LP with 12k’s Sawako on Schole Records!MP3 Folk Music DownloadDirect Download: “Fragments EP” ZIPNetlabel: www.creation-centre.comArtist Website: www.myspace.com/diskm",

Machado hails from the city of Lisbon and is part of the intimate artist-rooster at Merzbau, the Portuguese Netlabel run by Tiago Sousa. The music Machado releases under the Triangular-moniker is a ghostly mix of field-recordings, analog instruments and a lot of reverb.Three rather short tracks that bring forth an atmosphere of intense melancholy (even depression), nostalgia and decent creep. First track “Loathe” starts with processed trumpet or cello, it’s hard to say. Undefined field-recordings emerge into a motive of precisely distorted synthesizer which takes on the main pitch of the billowing string-arrangement.“Doria” afterwards has a similar mood but features some more pronounced guitar play. Alongside Machados whispered vocals, the heart rendering guitar melody injects a big potion of melancholia to João Triangular’s rather sober drones. The last track is “Untitled” and comes off with a fine Theremine-like synth texture and processed Moog-flutes. Quite minimal but I like it.P.S.: The absolutely awesome artwork is crafted by João Machao as well. Triangular, no?

All in all very talented groups and high quality recordings.The label is partly state-funded, which is a new way of running a netlabel and therefore some kind of prototype. Besides listening to the great music, it is also interesting to read their statements on free music culture and profit:”[]…we’re not here to make a profit.

Exactly the right knothole for Portland-based Owl Dudes. Their approach to experimental lo-fi Hip Hop incorporates shoegazing textures, hardcore rap and a good amount of knob tweaking. Fresh and challenging.The Owl Dudes are Jesse Johnson and Paul Wig, two white breads from boomtown Portland, Oregon. They published their debut “For The Feelers” by the hands of UK La Familia label, one of the most miraculous and enigmatic Notlabels I know. We get to know nothing about the Dudes despite free access to their songs in MP3 format. That’s fairly enough, no?“For The Feelers” consists of nine rather short tracks and drafts, blending into each other like a mixtape. Part vocal part instrumental, the Owl Dudes take the best from Hip Hop, Punk and electronic music to create something exciting and new. Their snotty raps sound tight and draw influences from both Hip Hop and US Hardcore.Beats are scattered loosly about their tracks, changing seats with noisy textures and unexpected samples which is excellently matched by the trashy sound of the EP. Where some of the vocal tracks make you think of Anticon-head Sole and in face of the Ambient textures Odd Nosdam has to be mentioned, the Owl Dudes do something very unique and refreshing.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-638” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/owldudes.jpg”Night time, owls at work.

            "content": "  Rockin' with their netlabel since 2004! Sven Swift and Sim SullenInterview with DIY-Netlabel 12rec // With their fabulous 50th release it’s time to visit the Do-It-Yourself Netlabel 12rec from Germany. Phlow met Sim Sullen and Sven Swift on the digital highway to have a chat about the strategies, attitude and why they enjoy exploiting themselves in the name of music! Together we unravel some old 12rec-screenshots, watch once more our most favorite netlabel-video-clip to date and listen to their new compilation.12rec Netlabel is a two-headed squirrel. Most of you know already Sven Swift for his in-depth-reviews on Phlow-Magazine.com and his headstrong compilations he contributes to the world-wide netlabel-phenomena. In comparison Sim Sullen seems more quiet, but the head behind travels a lot through germany, fotographing creative commons- and web 2.0-conferences. I celebrated already together with them at Netlabel Festival Zürich in 2006 - and guess, what can I tell you about this netlabel-duet? Amusing, freaky and truly dedicated…Simon and Sven, how did you guys meet and how did you get the idea of coordinating a Netlabel together?Sven: Sim and me know each other from school days. We both grew up in a small city at the outer brims of the Ruhr Area in Northern Germany. We had a band and spend a lot of time photoshopping, doing flyers and stuff. We were listening to 60’s Jazz and electronic music which none of our friends did - I think that forced us together… The first recordings of our band Majestik12 were published on tape, but for the second album we decided to go online. That was out first glimpse of what the web can do for us. The opportunity to share music via the net were pretty exciting for us these days… imagine that, kids!One or two years later, a friend that just had started his studies at the KHM in Cologne came up with different demos fellow students had blessed him with. These were Sichtbeton, Yokölast and Jasmin. Simon already got in contact with the Netaudio scene, and listening to all this awesome left-field music we agreed to found a Netlabel as well.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-649” title=”12rec2004” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/12rec2004-125x125.jpg”Click on the thumbnails to see, how the 12rec-website looked like in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007! On the one hand, 12rec. seems to be a very serious project. On the other hand, I had the feeling that sometimes plain fun is your agenda. Is there a main concept behind 12rec., have you got a special intention or message while releasing free music or is it just a fun project?Sven: Both is true, actually. It’s definitely important to us that people recognize the Creative Commons license we’re working with; that listeners are aware of the fact that our music is free, in a political sense, if you dare. And we’re glad to be a label rather than one of these faceless file hosters! Despite our stylistic versatility, people know that there is no bullshit up at 12rec. Maybe the label concept sounds dated in times of UGC but this bit of nostalgia is something I can definitely live with.But neither Sim nor me are out for recruiting pees for the Netaudio fuzz. The main agenda is good music - good music, good artwork and a few well-written, humours words about the music. Are seriousity and humour contrary values? Don’t hope so!On the next page you get a private peek on how the 12rec-boys produce their wonderful CDs and why they like to enjoy exploiting themselves!  Extraordinary: See how music gets wrapped into beautiful and handmade cover-artwork!I can imagine quite a lot of people ask themselves: Why do these guys spend so much time to build a project like 12rec.? They earn nothing with it! Are these folks right? What would be your answer? What’s the benefit of running a Netlabel?Sven: You have to be a true bred lover of music to keep things going - next to a demanding money job… We get to hear so much wonderful music, talented artists from around the world become your friends, listeners send thank-you emails, these kind of things.Sim: The point that there is no profit involved also means some kind of freedom for us. Especially as a label far from mainstream it makes decisions so much easier not to have to think about revenue when planning new releases. We totally can let us lead by our taste and the appreciation for the artist and his work without worrying how many copies we will sell. To us it´s a very convenient situation not to care too much for broad popularity in our work as a Netlabel.Sven: Discover new music, meet new people, DO something. I feel fine to be able to go to London, Tokyo, New York or Montreal and find a bed at someone I exchanged only emails with before. That’s it.Simon, you travel a lot through Germany, visiting conferences where Creative Commons-projects and ideas about these licenses are discussed. Why do you think as a Netlabel-head, that the Creative Commons is so important? What are positive and negative effects of the Creative Commons? Are there any loopholes?Sim: The Creative Commons licences are not that much of a revolution or an anti-copyright thing than many people think. To me it’s more of a logic and natural development of the way we deal with intellectual property in the digital age. In times where the distribution of creative works is no longer a privilege of a few elitist publishing companies, a copyright law that was basically created in times where publishing meant printing letters on paper with huge machines is no longer appropriate - especially for the legion of kids who create stuff just for the sake of being creative! Some people might disagree, but not every producer of intellectual property thinks in dimensions of ‘creative industries’.For a Netlabel like 12rec., the CC licences are a very comfortable and easy way to let people know that they will not be sued for copying music but still have the security that the works will not be used in a way that is not okay for the artists. And the musicians get the chance to reach a way bigger audience than by selling some self produced CDs at concerts. As Sven said before, releasing under CC is also some kind of a political statement. Many people have never heard of CC and are not even aware of those Free Culture issues. When we can make some people think about such topics as a side effect of delivering great music, well, that sounds quite worthwhile to me.On the last page of our interview we finally celebrate with 12rec their incredible 50th release, the “so much achieved. so much left to do.”-compilation. Get your hands on one of the rare CDs!Sven, you write your own blog, submit reviews to Phlow-Magazine.com and publish experimental mixes on the web. Do these activities reflect themselves in your work for your Netlabel?&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-646” title=”cover-artwork-50th-12rec-compilation” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/cover-artwork-50th-12rec-compilation.jpg”  Dark future for 12rec? No, they're just beginning, read on!Sven: Personally, I have a devastating hunger for new music and would ruin me (and my wife) if I would have to buy music every time I want to listen to something new. I purchase a lot of vinyl, but Netaudio is my methadone, haha! And you really can do something for the artists you discover - I mean, Ellen Alien won’t care if I write on my blog that her new album is awesome (which is), Gareth Dickson and Etienne Michelet do.The music we’re releasing at 12rec. is much more “Pop” than the sound I’m listening to normally. All these experimental Ambient-things I happen to write about don’t have a place at our label, and that’s pretty OK. Others do better. 12rec. doesn’t want to be Serein, IOD, Nexsound or Resting Bell. Nevertheless, certain artists came to 12rec. after I wrote about them- Nicolas Bernier, Astrowind, to name only two.If I am honest, I always had some troubles listening to the wide range of 12rec. music releases. This changed a lot with your anniversary compilation. I have the feeling that you guys worked on this release really hard. Your musical idea of putting Indiepop together with experimental sounds and Hip Hop music works extraordinary good on this record. Please tell us how you met all these musicians, how you coordinated the compilation and stuff…‘Sven: Maybe we’re expecting a bit too much from our listeners… I find myself being a bit envious for these extremely homogenous Netlabels, take Zymogen for example. But as 12rec. is a direct projection of Simon’s and my taste in music, everything different would have been fake. So, in consequence, our beautiful sampler is pretty much of a roller coaster-ride, too. And yeah, it was a HELL lot of work.&lt;img class=”left” title=”compilation-front-200” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/compilation-front-200.jpg”I was sending out emails to our housekeeping artists in January this year, asking them to deliver something extraordinary awesome for this sampler. Most of them did, and we had the dirty job to sort out the very good from the veryvery good. Plaistow, adcBicycle, The Sleeping Tree and Ian Hawgoodare absolutely new to our rooster and they will all publish at 12rec. later this year. The Great Mundane and Konntinent are “guests” who are related to us but won’t release something very soon. If you are familiar with 12rec. already, you will probably be happy to hear that we’ve got new tracks by Crepusculum, Daniel Maze, Sichtbeton, Heezen and many more. Stephane Obadia, another long time follower, did the photos for the artworks.All in a whole, “So Much Achieved” represents our label in all it’s diversity. It’s the best we could give. We got 1000 copies of the digipak CD done and try to sell them as cheap as possible. Maybe you have some six bucks left on your Pay Pal-account and like to order. In case you don’t, take a look at our 50s-jubelee mini site. The compilation is online for free download as well. Of courseMany thanks, for the interview!",

But their 150. release finally got me. Preslav Literary School and is the alter ego of Adam Thomas, UK-born Berlin resident, head honcho of Glosses Fur Die Masses records and serious researcher of experimental Ambient. “Autumn Bricolage” is the MP3 re-release of Adam Thomas’ first album as PLS, published on CDr back in late 2006. Thomas labels his way of compositing “Tape Music” which means that he’s using old tape decks, dictaphones, radiobroadcast rather than digitally piling tracks. Enhanced with various found sounds and field-recordings, Collage Ambient is the new genre I’d like to coin (ah, by the way, that’s Musique Concrète, no?). Half way music, halfway aurual investigation, “Autumn Bricollage” is subtitled “Soundscapist Compositions Set In English Parkland”.For experimental electronic music, the way things are recorded and the specific hardware used are of utmost importance. The approach of PLS results in rich textures and a specific sound that makes his tracks unique and memorable. Analogue hissing blends with lo-fi field-recordings, minimal melodies are introduced, synth textures correspond with the tonal shift in the found sound of an air con hum (or whatever). The whole album mixes seamlessly so please make sure to listen to the whole thing rather than just the track I picked!&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-652” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/psl_live.jpg”Anonymous Soundcapist (photos by James Grey)MP3 Ambient Music DownloadRelease Site: Preslav Literary School - “Autumn Bricolage”Direct Download: “Autumn Bricolage” ZIPNetlabel: www.clinicalarchives.blogspot.comArtist Website: www.myspace.com/preslavliteraryschoolAdam Thoma’s Label: www.myspace.com/glossesfurdiemasses",

But you have to cut the shit everywhere, sometimes a really huge pile. But when you find those nuggets, you’re excited that musicians allow you to spread the music, the vibes and show them legally to your friends. But there are still more reasons why netlabels are amazing, read on!Why I like netlabels so much!  Netlabels invite me to spread their music for free and let me make propaganda not only by mouth, but with music itself!  If I do an interview with a netlabel or if I write about netlabel-music, I always can attach music to make my articles sound!  A small vinyl label produces a limited copies of a release. If the release is sold out, it’s sold out - Basta! A netlabel keeps its backcatalogue online - hopefully forever!  Even dead netlabels still can be heard in their tomb over at archive.org!  Free Culture and Gift Economies are an utopia, but more and more this movement is speeding up, thanks to the internet. Netlabels are a big part of this movement.Have I forgotten any important reasons?Please give the critics some proove…And here are some - hopefully - excellent examples to proove my points:  With each netlabel music compilation I am able to make propaganda for musicians and netlabels I like. Please download them :)  Read articles about Netlabels like Camomille, Broque or Dharmasound and listen directly to their music!  If a music label closes its gates, the music no more available. But sleeping netlabels like subsource.de don’t operate but keep their identity live, visible and can still be experienced while dreaming.  There are netlabels which had an impact, which where long gone. Thanks to the archive.org and scene.org-shrines they are still available like Textone, Tokyo Dawn or Please Do Something.  Just read and listen on Phlow-Magazine.com, dig the wonderful nerdy netlabel directory over at netlabels.org or feed your download-manager with music from www.archive.org/details/netlabels.Once again: **Have I forgotten any important reasons?

Everybody with just the slightest interest in experimental Ambient: go download!Darren McClure “Miniature Forest Remix” (MP3)offthesky “Miniature Forest Remix” (MP3)Usually, I avoid talking about the same Netlabels over and over again. But this release is too important to keep it in the closet just because I wrote about Brometer and IOD two weeks ago. The Green Kingdom, Detroit-based musician and graphic designer gave out the song “Miniature Forest” from his self titled CD debut for a bunch of house-keeping IOD artists to let them redraft his delicate Ambient textures.Exile-Irishman Darren McClure takes the original with him on a trip underwater. Not a trip to abysmal pits but a smooth skin-dive through colorful coastal waters. SEM-mastermind Alexandre Navarro treats the song with his cine scope delay mainly. Navarro’s edit is pretty close to his own sound of semi-experimental, melancholy guitar Ambient and brings forth a sniveling feel of prairie vastness. Letna (SEM) and Mexican Manrico Montero (of Mandorla-fame) rework the track from a similar minimalistic point of view, the former with a good amount of Pop, the later with a rather dark approach. Both at huge success.&lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-610” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/offthesky.jpg”My favorite remix comes from Jason Corder a.k.a. offthesky, a guy you probably have heard of.

Tiago Sousa of Portuguese Merzbau Netlabel releases his fourth album “The Western Lands” at Resting Bell and manages to establish himself as the Brian Eno of desert Rock. Textures that flicker like hot air, wishful guitar melodies and desolate folk pickings make up for a unique piece of campfire Ambient.“The Western Lands” is a Folk record. Despite all the processing, Sousa’s guitar-play is what makes up all songs on his album. A handful of simple melodies, some improvisation and a lot of repetition, an trashy amp and the courage to go public with it, Tiago Sousa doesn’t need too much to release a cool album.Weightlessly draped on the infinite howl of a fuzzy guitar, piano and acoustic guitar come together for a beautiful waltz at “The Roads To Western Lands”. It’s stunning to hear the instruments merge, interfere and ab initio build new structures. Imagine Belgian Free Folk-collective Kaboom Karavan in a slightly more traditional arrangement. Focusing on the interplay of noisy, electric guitar and fine unplugged pickings on top, “Waghdas” is another good example for Tiago Sousa’s approach to experimental (Folk) music.

Right from their junk flats in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, glue-sniffers DJ Internet and Kid Kool combine a myriad of jumble sale samples to atmospheric collages of experimental Hip Hop, digital Turntableism and, every now and then, the old floozie Pop. Ingenious on second try.Most innovative music needs repeated listen. Consider Free Jazz: the unexperienced ear can’t sort out the fractalized grooves and widespread harmonies. Autechre might sound random if you’re not used to experimental electronic music. Madlib’s beats for himself as Quasimoto can be considered as unfinished drafts someone accidentally dropped rhymes on top.Internet &amp; Kool are neither Free Jazz or IDM but can be compared with Madlib, Kid Koala or cLOUDDEAD. Both guys are well-known producers and label heads from the (East-) Berlin Rap underground. Internet spins the wheels as DJ V-Raeter and forms the duo Sichtbeton alongside MC Lunte. Kid Kool is Felix K., founder of Dubtech label Hidden Hawaii, journalist and producer. He’s also part of the Hungry Men crew. As a band, Internet &amp; Kool produce loose sample-based Hip Hop, sometimes smooth and atmospheric, sometime rough and edgy and closer to radio play than truebred Rap.

His wonderful five-track EP “Three Feet Of” was secretly released at IOD, the French Netlabel build from the leftovers of EKO and SKM. Airy-fairy lo-fi Folk, psychedelic chamber music and ad hoc recordings into the microphone of Sargison’s laptop. Ingenious. IOD Netlabel is run by Alexandre Navarro. He had a good time with EKO and Standard KLIK Music from 2005 to 2007 but decided to go “for real” with SEM in 2008. Up to now, SEM published two beautiful CDs (The Green Kingdom and Navarro’s solo debut “Arcane” ). The tiny Netlabel IOD is used to host the free back catalogue of it’s Netaudio-precursors and features fresh downloads every now and then. Alex, we’d like to see some more enthusiasm, some more promotion for IOD because EPs like “Three Feet Of” by Brometer need to be heard!“From One Two” is a composition of subtle brilliance. Loopy guitars, organ, chimes, some dull beats and everything is filtered through omnipresent field-recordings. Like a Four Tet-remix of a Nick Drake song. Elegantly entangled, “A Trap” fuses forward- and backward guitars with tape hiss and ghostly synth beeps. A midnight walk trough the moor can be imagined at “Rotation” . A slow synth pulse, grumpy noise and a wobbling synth-line makes me think of the recent Portishead album. So much talent!

Allthough this is the first image that comes to ones mind, Bufis music is different from simple computer generated electropop. His indiedance has a lot to offer. The synthpop and electro funk elements as well as the catchy pop hooks let me think of Daft Punk.

For the sixth edition, I decided to go for Netaudio-hardliner Buben and the haunting comic-artwork for his “Primogeniture” EP at Myuzyk Netlabel.Central part of the front cover is an amphibian- or fish-like creature, lurking in the lower middle of the picture. Image a black water lurch or some kind of dark-skinned catfish. Long antennas or barbels arise from the creatures forehead. In a similar manner, additional “antennas” in different noxious colours are displayed. Broad white bands to the far left and right inspire the effect of looking at a mysterious aquatic creature, siting at the ground of a jolly brook. The artist’s name “Buben” is put on a sticker-like circle in the very middle of the artwork. Four bulky leaves bloom from this spot, sending a set of red spermatozoa (?) to the upper end of the artwork.I like this cover for different reasons. The choice of color is as adventurous as ill-minded and disturbingly beautiful. In concert with the bright white elements and the zippy cartoon-style illustrations, any obvious Gothic clichés are avoided. Casual Fiend managed to create a certain kind of tension, derived from the chosen use of acute angles in a set-up of smooth curves, their specific idea of color and a vague, rural sexuality that eventually exists in my head solely.

Due to their rare promotion activities, I missed it back then but re-discovered it now. The bulky titled “Sampler” is something like a best of-compilation including exclusive tunes as well. Most songs can be found on “Solina Sea”, initially released as part of the “Mineral Series” at Benbecula records, some are derived from his debut “Spruce Goose” published by vanished Sleeping Man label.Gareth Dickson writes beautiful acoustic Folksongs with an idea of gentle Jazz. Decently processed by reverb and delay, Dickson “stretches” his chords to slowly evolving ambient textures that bring forth memories of Labraford, Gastr Del Sol or Berlin-based Taunus. His vocals are a obvious bow to Nick Drake, but he uses them in a distinct manner. Despite singing strophes and choruses he rather scatters fragments of text across the tracks, some songs work without vocals at all. Gareth Dickson manages to satisfy both the Folk- and the fans of experimental music. An awesome record!

The moroccan musician MLY, who is releasing his work under the name Dubosmium, has recently put out an EP that draws quite a different picture. From atmospheric ambient soundscapes to hard electronic drum ‘n’ bass elements, The “Green Element” EP creates its own world of dub music.Dubosmium - “Istandub (Supermoog)” (MP3)(MP3)Dubosmium - “Overdub Da Dub (Yarkouy)” (MP3)Dubosmium - “7Heavens” (MP3)“Green Element” is partly a review of Dubosmiums earlier release “Horiozontal plane polar Dub”, but it also features three new tracks, that give us a little impression of his forthcoming longplayer, that will be released later in 2008.The first track (“7Heavens”) is very atmospheric in its sound and it features an ever-present oriental touch, that is highlighted through vocals by Said Jaha. The next two tracks are quite similar in it’s sound and make it a lot easier to find obvious connections to dub music. But still, the songs feature a strong ambient element. The last five tracks from the “Green Element” EP are remixes by other Fresh Poulp artists like Rafiralfiro, Xena Supermoog, Silent Bells, Duck and Yarkouy that range from ambient tracks (“Tuvadelic Odyssey”) to hard electro-dub with drum ‘n’ bass elements (“IstanDub”).All in all the “Green Element” EP is a different and interesting approach towards dub music. To me it’s still warm in it’s mood but at the same time dark and deep.

Just recently, Michelet released two EPs at the notorious Resting Bell Netlabel and over at Digital Biotope. But I’d like to talk about his former minialbum “Bleu Vespéral - A Music For Harmonium” published via La Nouvelle Dégelée earlier this year.I’m not actually sure if “Bleu Vespéral” is produced on a “hardware” harmonium solely. The sound of the instrument’s pipes is clearly there but I would have expected some more noises, certain glitches that occur if you hit the instrument’s keys, chiffing and such. “Bleu Vespéral” sounds very clear, ethereal, even sacral with it’s huge cathedral reverb flags.Whatever. Seven songs, rather short, stricly featuring the wide range of sound provide by the “reed organ”. Michelet is best when his compositions feature minimal harmonic changes and drifts. The second tune “Arcs (Mobiles)” e.g. fuses Ambient and Chambermusic, huge and beautiful. Wouldn’t have been a dropout on the Nest EP. The delicate flute-sounds at “Hexa” are wonderful and the slightly optimistic “Cromorne” brings forth a soothing feel of late-summer nostalgia I enjoy a lot. As a comparions, Processing… comes to my mind. A good EP in a whole although some songs are missing certain hooks.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadDirect Download: Etienne Michelet - “Bleu Vespéral” (ZIP)Netlabel: www.lanouvelledegelee.comArtist Website: www.myspace.com/etiennemichelet",

            "content": "A magic Joyride // Although this sounds like Intelligence Dance Music at the first sight, it is not. “Embarrassing Triangle” from Iqtu is a magic trip. The album is one of those releases that I got so much addicted to, that it is almost hard to resist to listen to: days, nights, at work, everywhere. The 55 minute trip unfolds after some beats after some minutes you don’t count which track is playing anymore, but wander completely in that special room the music opens.Iqtu - “You Cramp My Style” (MP3)Iqtu - “Pink Poetry” (MP3)Iqtu - “Aiken” (MP3)Nothing matters anymore. Happy tunes unite with floating beats, the IDMish sounds have not show teeth, but a breath of magic is closely in on their side. Airy windows of wonder and opportunity. And then sometimes little fragments of game-like soundeffects just make you wonder, while the trip goes on. Also some excellent precise breaks are on this release.This is the 20th, and maybe the most grown-up, release on the brilliant II-Music netlabel. The Label normally features music, that go from chiptune to miniature compositions made with chip. All releases combine clever music with extreme high quality. Something like Iqtu. Definitely my dig of the month.This release reminds me far on the Milky Beats LP from Original Recipe, that was released some years ago on the web, and still remains one of the most precious releases that you can download. Similar music structures and vibes are also on this album. Other reference coordinate would be music from Ulrich Schnauss.MP3 IDM Music DownloadDownload: Iqtu - Embarrassing Triangle (ZIP Archive)Release: Iqtu - Embarrassing TriangleNetlabel: II MusicArtist: iqtu.com/",

            "content": "Interview with Broque Netlabel // The German label Broque follows a mixed strategy. Under the clever management of Christian Kausch and Heiko Schwanz Broque distributes music in several formats and ways. While DJs can buy vinyl-records worldwide at their record dealer of choice, the netizens get free mp3 music released under a creative commons licence on their website. To complete the cycle of music distribution musiclovers can purchase MP3s of the vinyl releases on Beatport. We talked to Christian Kausch to figure out, what’s important for a professional netlabel today, how you push your music into webshops and if you can make some profit out of it.While Broque recently pushed out a fantastic release called Pseudónimo “terra firme e.p.” we thought, we might talk to the grown up (not only) techno netlabel from Germany. And, yes, we squeezed out some interesting questions for you. Keep on reading!Whose scepter is swinging behind the Broque-curtain?      We’ve got two main characters behind our curtain: Tend (Christian Kausch) is the man for promotion, A&amp;R, webdesign, licensing, booking, accounting, shipping, scheduling and all things like these. Granlab (Heiko Schwanz) is the technical director with the key for our servers, the connection to our digital ditributors and also the mastering head. We’ve got a new art director, named Thomas Gumprecht, and many other helpers, we can’t exist without.  &lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-570” title=”christian_kausch_heiko_schwanz” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/christian_kausch_heiko_schwanz.jpg”Music connects! Friends for lifetime, partners on Broque Netlabel: Christian and HeikoMost netlabels publish their music only as digital downloads. You follow a mixed up strategy and distribute your music as mp3 and vinyl. Why do you do so?      We were never friends of seperating drawers or formats. I think, so we’ve got the chance to get attention by all music-fans without any restrictions.  When you publish a new vinyl, how do you choose the tracks? Are there any guidelines you follow?      We’ve got a very nice artist pool and get many demos every week. Our only guideline is, that the music must have soul and groove. It’s very important for us to get to know the artists. We want to work together to get new inspirations and hope they get also new experiences by working together with us and our other artists. It’s so nice to see, if new people come together making new projects or just have a good time by exchange or something like that.          It’s terrible, because there are so many people who can’t talk a normal sentence with you, or they have ideas from another world – so we must say “No way!”.  &lt;img class=”alignnone size-full wp-image-572” title=”tend-granlab-broque-1” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/tend-granlab-broque-1.jpg”You also sell your music also digitally - for instance on beatport. Was it difficult to sell your music through beatport? How did you manage to sell your music there?      We’ve got a digital distributor, but also single contracts with separate platforms. We only sell the music as mp3 we sell as vinyl, too. We need the additional profit in this case. Our general mp3-way is free.  Is selling MP3s a lucrative way for musicians to earn money? Would you advise netlabels to sell their music through a music-shop such as beatport?      Yes, you can earn money with it. But I can’t advice it in every case. We don’t switch our label philosophy into only selling, because we think, we lose many fans with it. At this time, we are a good reference for our artists. In another way we would be a soulless label like others on beatport without an own face. As netlabel you can reach thousands of people, as mp3-sell-label with the same concept you’ve got maybe 20 till 50 downloads. Ok, you’ve got the chance to get more, but only great music isn’t enough. And you must know: Netlabel users and people who buy the music via beatport and so on are different target groups. So I must ask, what is more important for you, if you totalize?  If somebody discovers Broque the first time, what five releases should he definetely listens to?      Its very hard, because we aren't a label for one night. So I hope I found the right style mix for the first date with us. But I think, you can find some more treasures on our site, if these teasers are interesting for you:          Mike Breitfeld - Landflucht (broque 003) Track: Technique4 (MP3)          It was our third EP and a real breakthrough. The chosen track is full of electric current and still one of our favorites. Its also a licenced demo track for Native Instruments Traktor DJ Studio 2.6.          10 Jahre Oderaufbrot The Remixes (broque 005) Track: The Caine Controlfreak (Granlab Remix)          I chose this Track, because it was a part of the remixes of our 10 years anniversary compilation CD. The CD was the start of our label and also the beginning of a very successful compilation series. And this remix was the best ever of Granlabs works, I think.          Cheslo Spring Droids EP (broque 021) Track: Mjidou          It was hard to decide between Lowtec and Cheslo to find a perfect example of our deep side. But I think, Cheslo was a real surprise with his great EP in his very own style and a real genius in his arts. But I really love Lowtecs EP, too!          Max Cavalerra Naturphenomenon (broque 024) Track: Der Mensch und seine Gnsehaut          Max is the artist with the most tracks on broque.de. The history of his nature phenomenon is very interesting. At first, nobody took note of it. But step by step, the people found this great fusion of music and now this EP is his most succesfull one on Broque. Two Tracks are now only available on Karmarouge Rec.          Nils Hoffmann Kurz &amp; Klein EP (broque 035) Track: Goodbye Glamour Maybe our greatest success ever? Ok, the tastes are different. But a real sample of our open sound policy.

Seamlessly glued to one big jam, PC-member Alan McNeill aka Engine7 proves his talent not only as a musician but as a filejockey and sensible A&amp;R, too.McNeill and Phantom Chanel introduces nine rather unknown Ambient composer, all of them working at the edge of Electronica, Drone and something like Postrock. Mercury synth-textures, drifty memories of guitar and a lot of noise are the common elements. Wonderful!Engine7 opens the mix with his trademark sound of Electronica beats and deep Ambient harmonies. Bleeding in, Parhelion (Ihor Dawidiuk from Toronto, CAN) basically produces sugar Noisepop that sounds like received from the bottom of a glacier lake. Experimental band Brakhage (CH) shift the overall sound to something more sparse and dark, extensively using field-recordings over bass-saturated instrumentals. Michael Henaghan aka Mosca, next to Engine7 the only artist I was familiar with, resembles this sound with his subtle melodies buried under a lava flow of down-pitched synth textures. Finally, youngster Lee “Svefn” Chapman takes you home with a high-spirited piece of Drone muzak from his recent EP “Lightness”.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadRelease Site: V.A. - “Phantom Channel Presents - Part I”Direct Download: V.A. - “Phantom Channel Presents - Part I” (ZIP)Netlabel: www.phantomchannel.co.uk****",

Somewhere between the simple sound of an acoustic guitar and some gentle handclapping, Jóvenes y Sexys placed lovely melodies, that will get stuck in your ears. To complete their little universe of lofi-pop, they added some fancy atmospheric sounds – sweet and soothing. Cheky and Loocila’s  Jóvenes y Sexys debut „Bruno EP“ starts with the sound of a cuckoo clock and introduces the song „El Reloj“ (The Clock). Just a few seconds later they come up with their omnipresent acoustic guitar that is the basis for all of their songs. As soon as the vocals set in, they catch you with sweet melodies that are often accentuated with suitably keyboard-sounds.While the first two songs are in Spanish, the second half of Jóvenes y Sexys’ „Bruno EP“ is in English. On „Gold Day“ they were supported by Joiejoiejoie, who is also releasing at the mexican netlabel Poni Republic. The last song of their lovely EP is called „Divine Hammer“ and is my favourite track by the mexican-venezuelan duo, because it just makes you sing along: “I’m just looking for one divine hammer. One divine hammer, one divine hammer. I’d bang it all day…” And let’s be honest: aren’t we all looking for a divine hammer sometimes?",

While “Autsaidub” rolls on dirty breakbeats along, “Autsaidnait” is a calm trip through on icy sounds. My favorite is still “Flecha”. The music begins with strange sounds, which sound somehow oriental.

Pourquoi me Reveiller was founded in 1998 and means “Why awaken” or in a broader sense “Why should I wake up”. In 2005 they recorded their debut full length “They took my bed outside”. Although the opener is called “bloody hours of nasty torture”, recording the album must have been great fun because each song on their debut LP sounds completely different.Besides the typical indie-setup (guitar, bass and drums), Pourquoi me Reveiller introduced piano, accordion, electronic sounds, samples and noise elements, that helped to create an eclectic indie-rock album, that ranges from experimental rock to acoustic pop.

The organic, sensitive and emotional sound of their homerecorded 13 track debut is highlighted through Paus and Marias voices that perfectly fit into the glockenspiel, piano, keyboard and guitar sounds. Their music is based on looped instrumental sounds that are usually slowly building up until the point where the drums or vocals start.Although “Adéu” and “Por” are my favourite tracks, you should get the whole picture by listening from the first to the last song of their very personal and intimate album, which is “a mixture of nostalgia, nature and “home made” to them. What is also very special about U_mäs album, is their decision to sing in their native language (Catalan). For people who are interested in the meaning and lyrics of their songs, Pau and Maria have added an explanation and translation to each of their songs.MP3 Folk/Acoustic Music DownloadWebsite: www.umabcn.comDownload: U_mä - s/t (Error-Lofi) ZIPRelease: U_mä - s/tNetlabel: www.error-lofi.com/",

            "content": "Hardboiled Electronic Hip Hop // Niteffect is back with an 30-minutes length EP for the German Kreislauf Netlabel. While his former “Fragments” EP was more like a glimpse of Miklos Labady’s talent for hypnotic beats, “Lost Identity” is the prove of his qualities in songwriting, too. Ten songs that oscillate from Downbeat to instrumental Hip Hop to IDM. Versatile and catchy. Hungary-born Miklos Labady is quite active in the Netaudio-scene. While his Niteffect-moniker is strictly Kreislauf, a few records under the name of Nick Otheen are online at Enough Records and Laced Milk. Labady extracts the brooding darkness of Dubstep, takes the groovy downtempo beats of Hip Hop (some might say Trip Hop) and plays his dirty little game by adding the right amount of Electronica.“Lights Off” and “Blur Emotion” feature grumbling bass synthesizers that sound like pitched-down Mr. Oizo and spiced with some fine cuts at “Lights Off”, Tape vs RQM. Tracks “Go With The Flow” or “No Way To West” have a stronger connection to Leftfield Electronica with blurry melodies and Boards Of Canada-style melancholia. My favorite tune on Niteffect’s “Lost Identity” is “Tropical Heat” however. With a slight shift to Trance and Afrobeat rhythmics (check the percussion!), “Tropical Heat” affects you like a maelstrom. Hypnotic, ominous, a trip into The Heart Of Darkness.MP3 Hip Hop Music DownloadRelease Site: Niteffect - “Lost Identity”Direct Download: Niteffect - “Lost Identity” (ZIP)Netlabel: www.kreislauf.org**Artist Website**: www.virb.com/nlz",

            "content": "The CC Mixter Remix-Project by Calendar Girl // Tamara Barnett-Herrin - better known as calendar girl - started a fantastic project back in October 2006. The idea was simple: Write each month a song and release the original material under a creative commons licence. Than ask other producers and musicians to remix the songs. Now one and a half year laters Calendar Girl looks back on the results: more than 300 remixes! And like she promised she publishes a record with 12 fantastic songs. A story on how to use the web to interact with other musicians worldwide.Calendar Girl - “May” (MP3)“I write one song a month. You remix and feedback. We make a record.”When and how did you get your idea of your Calendar Songs-Project?I’d been writing demos in my bedroom for a couple of years, but I kept finding myself very frustrated by the process of never having anything “finished”. And I felt I was working in a vacum. I could play my music to friends and family but getting it “out there” - whatever that means - felt so impossible.I never want music to become a chore, or to find myself complaining about making music, how hard it is, etc., etc. It became clear to me that this process of making demos can also at the same time make you very bitter! So I tried to think of a way for my music to find another route into the ether…And obviously putting it online was the best solution. But of course, MySpace isn’t everything… So I kind of fashioned the idea of writing new songs for a website, where I could draw people in by inviting them to remix my songs. I wanted the site to have the air of a challenge to it, something where you could come back to check up on my progress, so I challenged myself to write a new songs each month that had to be inspired by that month.That way I gave people a reason to come back to the site after their first visit, like “I wonder if she made it this month…”. It all went online in October 2006. It took about two months to put it together from when I had the idea.If you speak in terms of music-engineering, there is a saying “Garbage in, Garbage out!”. It means, if you record music badly, you can’t do anything to make it sound better. What kind of equipment did you use to produce your songs? Are they all recorded at home?I’m not sure I agree with that saying. I would rather listen to a bad recording of a good song than an amazing recording of a terrible song. And I put all my faith in people having the same attitude as me, because I know I can’t make the most perfect recordings.I record at home into Garage Band, I’m terribly lazy, I haven’t even made soundproofing! All the A Cappellas sound like my bedroom! But I made a decision to it this way - to really concentrate on writing instead of spending all my time getting the best equipment and teaching myself how to master it. Maybe I’m a bit of a purist but I like things that sound like what they are.&lt;img  title=”calendar girl in nyc” src=”http://phlow-magazine.com/images/calendar-girl-trumpet-250x187.jpg”On the inner side of the CD you write: “The experience has gone beyond even my most elaborate expectations.” How did you kick off your project? What did you do to let the people know of your project?I tried to visit internet forums, but you know what its like - nobody likes someone spamming in forums! I wasn’t already embedded in those places. I took a chance and posted an A Cappella at www.ccmixter.org and began to get a lot of remixes from that community. There is an amazing gathering of talent there. But I didn’t spend hours and hours trying to market the site. I wanted to see what would happen.And of course what happened was that the Internet wove its magic spell and people just ended up finding me. I like how organic and mysterious the Internet can be. I really love the feeling of throwing something (in this case a song) into the darkness and waiting for someone to throw it back to you - that’s what the web represents for me.Apart from composing each month a new song. How much time did you invest in your project each month?Usually I spent about three weeks digesting news and ideas and fooling around, not really concentrating on working and then a week in a state of total panic as I tried to finish the song. It was a rollercoaster but I loved it.You received hundreds of mixes. One of my favorite mixes is the remix for “May” by Apeskinny. The remix does not appear on the album. How did you choose the songs for the compilation?That’s one of my favorites too. Believe me, I had many, many favorites that didn’t make the record. I can’t explain or justify my decisions other than say that my criteria for selection was very personal and subjective. I chose the remixes that really spoke to, or reflected, the songs. Every mix I chose was not only technically interesting or whatever but also somehow captured the spirit of the song.For example the January “Stalactite” mix by Max Plank has this frosty arctic feeling to it. The song (original) is all about broken resolutions, and somehow the tone of the mix related to the feeling I was singing about. It’s minimal techno with this long slow build up to the vocal, and there is something shivering and alive in it.Where can people buy and get your CD? Is it also available for download?It will be available to order directly from www.calendarsongs.com on the 26th May. It will also be available to download from CD Baby and maybe some other distributors too.I hope you enjoy it!Thank you for the interview!Links to Remixes, Music and Calendar GirlWebsite: www.calendarsongs.comAudio and Songmaterial: www.ccmixter.org/people/calendargirl/uploads",

            "content": "Adjusted Post-Rock // The great talent of the post rock five-piece from Rotterdam is to carry easy accessible melodies and themes into a genre that is known for its difficult access. Solaire pull you into their spherical world of music and just before you seem to drown in this fairly deep ocean of instrumental guitar driven sound, they give you an unexpected push from below that hits you just hard enough to realize where you are: somewhere safe. Solaire can not be labelled as a typical post rock band, because they are expanding the range of this genre by introducing lyrics, samples (that partly seem to come from original movie quotes) and easy to follow guitar melodies that somehow make the songs predictable. But this impression of predictability won’t last for long, because their repetitive and catchy melodies seem to be a thoughtfully placed stylistic device to prepare the forthcoming musical eruption, that creates a unique and intense moment. Their debut full length “…and then I strapped explosives to my body” is a collection of those intense moments and it is available at the dutch online promotion and distribution platform for independent bands, as well as record label Dying Giraffe Recordings, where you can download some of their songs for free, published under a Creative Commons License.If you want to know what they look like, you can click here to see them in action in their video to “the great went”, directed by Margarita Kouvatsou.Free MP3 DownloadRelease Site: Solaire - “…and then I strapped explosives to my body”Artist Website: http://www.solairemusic.com/Artist Myspace: http://www.myspace.com/solairemusic",

            "content": "Free Music Digger // With his Podcast called “Machtdose” Podcaster Roland presents a treasure box full of the most terrific netlabel-music around. While fascinated hopping from country to country he presents music from all kind of genres. His Machtdose Show gives a damn about music-boundaries and leads you each time into new corners of the netlabel world. An interview with a Netaudio-Podcaster.When did you make your first contact with the free music scene, especially netlabels? Do you remember the first release you downloaded?I can’t remember exactly but it must have been in 2003 or 2004 when I had discovered the (now dead) webjay.org site. On webjay you were able to create playlists with links to online available mp3’s - and through playlists by other users I became aware of netlabels like Observatory, Tokyo Dawn and Bevlar (unfortunately all three aren’t active anymore, last two are even down for a longer time now).I then presented in my weblog ronsens a first playlist called sentimental journey in netaudio and that was the start of collecting netaudio tracks by myself. The next lists were then already published on Machtdose, a more music-centered weblog originally initiated by my friend Gregor. Some time later I went then to present the tracks in a podcast with moderation.What drives you to dig especially into the world of netlabels?Simple answer: the music. This is really what it is all about: the music and nothing else. If you visit a netlabel site you normally know exactly nothing about the presented tracks and artists. You just listen to their music - and then it’s on your site to decide if you like it or not. There’s no marketing strategy, no public image, no music critic who tries to take influence on that.Next big point is that you have access to really international music which you wouldn’t listen to otherwise, from artists all over the world - and not only the main markets. In our last episode we’ve had music from Bulgaria, Portugal, Germany, Russia, Indonesia, Hungary, Austria, the United States, Spain, France, Great Britain, Belgium, Canada and Argentinia - and it’s like that month per month.A lot of people claim that the netlabels are a bunch of amateurs. “They give their music away for free”, they say, “because otherwise noone would buy their records.” What would be your answer to such a statement?Besides it isn’t true and that there are enough examples of “professional” musicians who have released on netlabels?Even if you agree that most netlabel artists won’t earn any money with their work - what’s wrong with that? Often enough it is for example a conscious decision not to follow any commercial logic - like the one which is basis of this statement: that commercial success is a serious indicator for the quality of music. I think most of us have made other experiences, just listen to top seller music charts and you know what I mean.Last not least: if you take a look on the development of the music market and the fact that music is getting more and more an “immaterial” good with profound consequences for its distribution, you shouldn’t be too snobby about netlabelism - on the contrary it will probably give you some hints of what could be possible future models for promoting music.If you compare the last years of so called netlabelism, what is your main impression? Are there any tendencies? What do you think about the future of free music and in particular about the future of netlabels?I don’t see a general trend right now - which is probably another plus: I think there is a vivid scene but actually it doesn’t act like some. We simply have a lot of people who are doing their things and that is it.As I intimated before - I really think that the future of “free” music is the future of music (distribution) in general. Our everyday life experience is already that we can get every kind of music “for free”, isn’t it?Your podcast-show delivers a wide range of different music styles. Have you any favorite netlabels and musicians?I have so many! There’s e. g. Monotonik which I call “the mother” because it is one of the oldest ones (200th release lately, congrats by the way). There are others like 12rec.net, aerotone, kreislauf.org, I could also take laridae or test tube - labels I know for longer but which have had some great releases especially in the last time. Also I permanently discover new promising labels, recently e. g. Dusted Wax Kingdom or Budabeats.At the end I would like to hear some music after talking about it. What are current Top-5-Free-Music-Songs?Ok, I will try to add some tracks which hasn’t been presented in Machtdose already and give a short comment to each:You’ve asked also for some favourite musicians - here’s one of them. Granlab, one of the broque makers (another excellent label), has just released a new EP, from it:granlab - “a sneaked suffer”One of the most interesting releases in the last time was for me XYDZOD - Y (puls09), a mashup of traditional African music and electronica, here’s the opener:XYDZOD - “afaera”Next one has not only a funny title it is a marvellous track from the latest release at Yuki Yaki and is in heavy rotation at home right now:David Carew - “Bored Of Canada”Another great discovery was the excellent Hiphop Label Random Flow, they have for instance the duo D3Zs who raps in English and Japanese (and this sounds beautifully).DZ9s - “Let the Music Play”At the end another all-time favourite artist, this time it’s iambic² and from his latest release (laridae037):iambic² - “this day goes nowhere”Thank you very much for the interview!Links and so…Website: machtdose.de Podcast: Machtdose Podcast",

            "content": "From time to time I stumble upon netlabel-releases which don’t convince me with the whole release. Unfortunately you discover sometimes on these albums true hidden treasures. What to do? Being picky? Right! Otherwise you would miss some really great tunes for your ears.Tosol - “Trip around Midnight EP” (Auflegware)German sound-engineer Tosol enjoys playing with sounds and tricky beats. His “Trip around Midnight EP” is a Techno EP where Minimal meets some Breakbeat-trickery. All tracks are slightly dirty and what I like best, is how Tosol twists beats and sounds. Unfortunately not the whole EP convinced me, but his track “Format 2000” is a monster. The track reminds me a bit of “Funk Phenomena” by Armand van Helden but is much more techy and stands for itself.Selffish -“Splash”Selffish is one of the netlabel-scene-veterans who already released his music years ago - especially on Thinner. On www.leibniz.ru he published a marvellous and cosy House-Tune called “.Splash”. This production is a true sweet spot. Open up and let some relaxed sounds into your home.glander - “shakershoes” (clear-cut-records)Glander is the labelhead behind the fabulous Yuki Yaki Netlabel. Over the years Glander develloped his own style of deep and relaxed House inbetween Dub and Techno. One of his best releases is his “Vate”-EP for 1Bit Wonder. “shakershoes” continues his quest in producing dubby melodic slow-motion groovers. Get on the bass for a relaxed ride and maybe you want to enjoy the whole compilation on clear-cut-records.k-jano - “evolution” (no-response)On “evolution” you find three tracks. All tracks are nice, but the title-track is the real hammer. “evolution” is a sunny tune with a melodic grooves and a trance-feeling. You can trip on this track the whole day and cool down after a busy day. Check out the whole EP at the Techno-House Netlabel no-response.Leavemotte - Steps for Kids (Ne Rnx Mix)Fragment Music from Russia is one of the well-designed website. I like the colors and the technical look of the website. The sound is similiar: clear, techy and well-produced. One of my favorite tracks to date is still the wonderful TechHouse Remix for Leavemotte done be Ne Rnx. The production of “Step for Kids” is melodic, deep and very groovy for a TechHouse-production.",

Despite his new record for the Welsh Serein Netlabel, Vancouver-boy Maze has an opulent discography in the back including releases for Test Tube, EKO, 12rec. and many more. His electronic music incorporates diverse genres from glitch to Pop. “Red After Image” is Daniel Maze’ masterpiece.While some of his former releases were either a bit too poppy or a bit too noisy for me, his full-length debut is just right. Not only well-balanced and “quality music” in terms of craftsmanship, slippy Maze can’t be hold to any style conventions. “Delightfully strange”, as Huw Roberts puts it on the liner notes.Warm in tone and texture, Maze mixes processed instruments like flutes and strings with a lot of crackling noise and programed beats. His melodies are splendid and lush and create an artificial 70’s Progrock-feel that goes along with the analog sound very well. The idea seems to resemble Jan Jelinek’s approach to Krautrock on Kosmischer Pitch.It is hard to pick certain songs as the whole album works best at full listen… my personal favorites are the first three tunes: “Steampunk” for it’s wishful slide guitar, the flutes and the wafting beats, “Nested Companion Template” with it’s cut-up vocal samples huge tonal synth-pads and finally “Subtropical Blasting Officier” which is just an incredibly weird piece of, well, Maze muzak.

Is it indie or pop, is it folk or singer/songwriter? It doesn’t matter. Their blend of humor and sadness, darkness and light is impressive and suddenly there is no need to label their music in terms of a genre.Susanna’s lovely voice, that doesn’t need a lot of instrumental support and Björn’s great talent to write extraordinary popsongs like “The best days of my life” formed a musical couple that fits perfectly. This is probably one reason for Björn to have Susanna with him as a constant member of his live band.“Blood bone / Home alone 2” contains four songs by each artist and it was originally released on tape(!), which was put out by froggi records in 2007. The Scandinavian music journal it’s a trap re-released the tape as a free digital EP.

Mark Denardo grew up with playing different traditional instruments and at a certain age he rediscovered the gameboy. Since then the New York (Brooklyn)-based musician and composer treats the nostalgic plastic machine as a valuable musical instrument and connects familiar gameboy generated 8-bit sounds with traditional blues and folk music, which is especially transparent on his “Lion, Tiger, Bear” EP (listen to the songs “Grass”, “Fare” and “Muse”).It is important to him to know how to use a technology to expand his horizons. So, using a gameboy is an evolution in composition to him. The way he creates his music is based on a DIY-attitude and spontaneous ideas that are being put on top of each other until there is something that can be called a song. Another fact that needs to be pointed out is that Mark Denardo joined the biggest chiptune conglomerate you can think of: 8bitpeoples. And that’s the place to be for an 8-bit-gourmet. If you want to know more about him, have a look at this short potrait or see him live and in action right here.MP3 Chipfolk Music DownloadRelease Site: Mark Denardo - “Lion, Tiger, Bear”Netlabel: www.8bitpeoples.comArtist Website: www.markdenardo.comArtist Myspace: www.myspace.com/markdenardo",

Because their music can be shared freely, the attention to their artists and their physical releases is growing. In the end of February they have released a nice compilation called “Sweets For The Wild 3”, where you can find various kinds of indie rock/pop music ranging from melancholic singer/songwriter to experimental, psychedelic pop songs and guitar-driven indie rock. “Sweets For The Wild 3” comes along as a double-album featuring 22 songs by 22 artists. Because most of the bands are French, you can gain a pretty interesting insight to the French indie scene. All songs are well produced and of high quality. While most of the songs are easy to follow, some of them need some time to get used to, so be patient. One thing is for sure: your patience will be rewarded, because there is a lot to discover: new and upcoming bands and more importantly, a lot of interesting approaches towards pop music.“Sweets For The Wild 3” is freely available as MP3 and OGG and while you are surfing the Another Record Website, make sure to check out their other releases, too.Free Indie Music MP3 DownloadRelease Site: V.A. - “Sweets For The Wild 3”Direct Download: Volume I MP3, OGG, Volume II MP3, OGGNetlabel : http://www.another-record.com",

This time, I decided to write about the simple photo artwork for Metal’s “Birthday Drones 3”. Metal is the band of Eric Adrian Lee known to our subscribers as Biathalon. On the picture, you can see a pastoral landscape. It’s summer. There is a sunbaked cow paddock, a lot of skies and, forming above a meandering country lane, a tiny little sand spout. A green belt of trees connects the fields with a smooth hill’s top in the back. There is not a single cloud in the sky. The dominant colors are green, light blue and ocher, all washed-out and faint. As Eric is from Portland, Oregon (north of California), this photo has probably been taken somewhere there.If you consider the artwork being composed of different layers, there is hill and heaven for the background, trees and lutescent velds in the midst, the road in front. Atop, two twigs come in from both left and right, the bigger one casting a substantial shadow. The only graphical element is a white sticker in the upper left announcing the name of the record.On a technical level, the composition of the photo has to be considered as brilliant. Arranged like a painting, all elements are in perfect union. The slight S-curve of the lane, the looming trees that frame the panoramic view on the distant hillside, even the position of the sticker is well-chosen. But what really makes me admire the artwork is a feeling of late Summer-quietness and wanderlust which overcomes me every time i look at the photo. Metal’s warm and ethereal guitar-drones are the perfect soundtrack for this kind of impression, so i cut a 12-minutes excerpt from the 40-minutes performances for you to experience the same.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadMusic: [Metal](http://www.myspace.com/metalisquiet “Metal @ Myspace”) Release: [“Birthday Drones III”](http://naturefilm.blogspot.com/2007/08/birthday-drones-three-2007.html) Artist (Music): www.myspace.com/ericadrianleeArtist (Painting): Eric Adrian Lee",

A musician who describes her music with “acoustic dilettante post-something” must be likeable, I assumed. As soon as I listened to the first seconds of Entertainment For The Braindead’s Hypersomnia EP, I immediatly underlined my first impression. And suddenly there was this image in front of my inner eye: A young woman from Cologne is sitting in front of her Laptop and starts recording plain and simply wonderful acoustic pop music, that is full of life and everything around it. The Hypersomnia EP is a collection of 13 very intimite and warm songs that you will play again, again and again. This dreamy female voice and these wonderful lullabies on Entertainment For The Braindead’s debut consist of a creative mixture of sounds, including keys, ukulele, guitar, flute, glockenspiel and unconventional percussion (boxes, cans and clapping). And it is hard to believe, but this album was recorded on a laptop, only with a USB-microphone attached to it.The 13 tracks from the Hypersomnia EP are available as a free download, but there is something that makes the whole EP even more valuable: there is a handmade physical edition of the album, which can be purchased on the artist’s website. Each CD is a unique, handmade product, freshly made for each order. The CD comes along with a linoleum printed cover and Julia, the woman behind Entertainment For The Braindead, doesn’t even feel like setting a price for her self released album, so it is your choice to pay whatever you think it’s worth.

This netlabel is about urban moods and love for music in general. Each single track leaves me fall into lovely worlds of sound and imagination.The opener is the insanely brilliant easy-listening pop-hit “handful of dust” from the band Musetta. Catchy vibes that take you from float to float, while real instruments play over a nice bubbly bassline. What surprises me most is, that Dharmasound also releases music that is played on a piano only. Also music, that would fit into the category of “classical composed” music. “Silence” or “Going to the city of Emeralds” from Francesco Lettera are such tracks. But my favorites are jazzy pieces.Some tracks are deeply rooted in trippy experimentalism, only suited for “special” ears, with not perfect polished sound. Pictures of small undergrounds couch-parties emerge. If you slice the more unusual tracks, like the classical or experimental ones, than a groovy, smooth and jazzy compilation stays. That compilation was thought as a DVD to buy or to made yourself, but I am somehow fond of the idea of customizing this one, in order to have it always on your side and to surprise people who say to you: “Ahh, netlabels. They only feature electronic music.”I really have my problems selecting according categories, because the cover every singe genre that is listed here, maybe except drum and bass or techno.

Back then, Ryo Nakata aka Ryonkt promised to releases some more music in the near future. After appearances at Audiotalaia, Mandorla and Noise-Joy, Nakata delivers his most recent masterpiece via the welcome hands of Resting Bell Netlabel.The four track EP is epically entitled “The World That was Surrounded by a Deep Forest and Warm Light”. The artwork shows a vivid painting by Karl Bodmer, a 1809 Swiss-born artist who traveled the “new world” portraiting the North American indigines and white folks settling the west. Alongside the highly figurative title and Bodmer’s moony paintings, you get a good idea of Ryonkt’s music without having heard a single note.Ambient guitar music, smooth in tone and rich in texture, this is what Ryonkt is known for. The overall warmth and sunlit harmony of his short-term meditations is striking at first try. Where “Slow Time” was lightly linked to Folk- and Pop music, “The World That was Surrounded” has a more experimental purpose; the fact that Nakata does not forget about certain harmonic and structural changes makes his music unique.

With their collaborative sampler called “Assignment 3” they give DJs and Artists a package of tools. In his mix Pheeks shows how the tools could sound if used right.In the retrospection Archipel looks back at its history and reconsiders what happened and will happen in the future:  After 3 years of existence, Archipel went a few steps further than what was originally planned. While the initial project was supposed to be about releasing samplepacks for a community, it grew to various scenes where it got even some vinyl releases. As things became more busy and demos flew in, we decided to aim at new goals and not propose a new samplepack.  After Pheek’s many tours, he came back with many ideas. One was to make a package of tools for DJs and performers. This would go a step further than just samples, we’d aim more at giving something for those who helped make us know: artists who play for crowds or for bedroom DJs.An interesting starting point. With his mix “Assignment 3” Pheeks goes the first steps and presents a minimal-techno-mix in the typical Pheek-Style. The mix sounds like we were sitting in the circuitry of a robot who’s travelling. While grooving on a stoic groove, clicks, little sounds and effects spin around our head.

Definitive a man of quantity, Lundh’s latest releases is a rich source for suckers of high quality Indie Pop, too.The Fiktion music is mainly based on warm guitar-chords, smooth bass-frequency synths and a handful of clicks &amp; cuts. I hear a lot of Americana in his lugubrious slide guitar sighs, Bonnie “Prince” Billy for example, or Califone (listen to “Subjektiv” and “Mjukt, Varmt and Fiktivt”). Taken in account the harmonious luxury and sugary darkness, even Chris Isaak works for comparison.The way Lundh uses bass guitar and synthesizers brings a cool Dub-element to his already splendid Pop-tunes. In comparison to Americana or Alt. Country, Fiktion is what UK Grime to traditional Hip Hop is: a dark twin, a hardheaded bastard, something new. Tortoise bassist Douglas McCombs (solo as Brokeback) is the only kindred spirit I have in mind. Songs “Fågelfostret” or “Coopers Dröm” will convince you to believe me.

While I was preparing to write something about their first release (a two-track EP of decent piano experimentalism featuring Hans Platzgumer), Innsbruck based analog fanatic Krowley hit the scene. “Four Pieces” is postmodern Renaissance music for the IDM afterglow.Krowley is 17-years young producer Felix Trawöger. His EP “Four Pieces” is a fresh mixture of melodic, analog instrumentation and urban beats and synths that reminds me a lot of “Eve Future”-releases by Kraftwerk-heirs Kreidler from Düsseldorf. With “I Saw My Lady Weep” Trawöger’s EP starts bare naked with piano, spinet and viola. The whole song is a beautiful little piece of chamber music, it’s contemporary origin only proven by minor hints. Second bassedanza “Ayre” combines _Aphex Twin-_style beat patterns with field-recordings and an enjoyable offbeat guitar motive.For “Cyre”, Trawöger descends even further into Pop. The dense guitar instrumentation is left as slave to the mighty LFO-groove of a synth bass-line. You can hear simple drums, somewhere in the middle a flute is introduced. It’s stunning to hear how seamless Krowley’s neo-Renaissance ideas accord to nowadays genres like IDM or Hip Hop. While last song “Pavane” (!) is a bit boring, “Cyre” is an awesome piece of left-field Electronica.

Taking place between the later two, con_cetta fits this musical terrain just perfect. Harmonious Ambient drones, spiced with glitch and field-recordings, how does that sound to you?The album opens with the hypnotizing string-miniature “2.53” that sounds like Arvo Pärt underwater. “hexagram” is a dense meditation on processed guitar and different high- and low-frequent noises which surprisingly make up a smooth listen. The song features Nicola Fernoli of Posthardcore outlet Go Down Moses on guitar. Afterwards, “sad.ay” is back with a dense piece of synthesizer Ambient, including echoing sine waves, a mesmerizing synth loop, songbirds and white noise distortion. For “hornplant”, con_cetta approaches Indietronica from an Ambient point of view, introducing a plain and beautiful texture to rattly sample beats. “Sclerosis” closes with the magnificent “calendaexl”, the orchestral counterpart of “hexagram”.When Lezrod sounds like the creaking ground below and Marihiko Hara is the conductor of ascension, Cordaro is capable to be both textural noisy and heavenly harmonic.

Just recently, I found the follow-up album “Anemone” being released by their label Red Antenna for free, too. Take some time and learn to love their brusk melodies and grooves.Tomorrowland is basically Stephen Baker and Nick Brackney, joined by Eric Morrison (of Füxa-fame!) on drums for the recording of “Anemone”. Hailing from Michigan, USA, Tomorrowland had an album out at Kranky before they teamed up with NYC’s Red Antenna. Both Baker and Brackney play their guitars through various effect pedals so one might assume there aint guitars at all. With Morrison’s loop-a-like drum patterns and a few drum machine-dubs, the songs are really composed for minimal effort. But although the sound is very pure, maybe even paltry here and there, something happens between bubbling guitars, delay and drum tracks.Krautrock is the magic word, and if you ever heard the first two Neu! records or Tortoise’s “Millions Living”-album, you probably can imagine what I mean. Tomorrowland-tunes like “Mineral” and “Anemone” are growers for groove and melody, in a straight Rother/ Roedelius/ Moebius-kinda way. These songs have sort of a retro-feel while tracks “Stormy” and “Unfadeable” come up with increased density and volume, clearly locating Tomorrowland into US Postrock with references to SST, Thrill Jockey and, well, Kranky.MP3 Rock Music DownloadRelease-Site:  Tomorrowland - “Anemone”Netlabel: www.redantenna.tv",

But how does an abandoned ironworks garage sound?Bartosz is a new face to Netaudio but hit the scene with two albums and one glorious EP just recently. While his LPs at 77industry and Crazy Language have a strong leaning towards IDM, Electronica and dark Ambient, the three track EP “Songs of Sens and Nonsens” at German Envizagae caught my attention with veritable Hip Hop-influences.Combining the dark and post-industrial atmosphere of 90’s IDM with a decent amount of melancholy and advanced skills in beats, Pleq bridges from SND to Burial to Tim Hecker. The awesome thing about Pleq is that he manages to keep sound design, song writing and and downright production skills in perfect balance. All tracks on “Songs of Sens and Nonsens” are tight to the bone, feature catchy melodies and will instantly get you by the necks. Herein, “I Hear Her at the Door Now” is among the best IDM/ instrumental Hip Hop-songs I know. Not matter if considered free or commercial.

In the case of Berlin backyard wrench Marow, the worn-out and atmospheric photos on his label’s website hooked me up initially.A straight bassdrum is something that leaves me quizzical. Thus, after surfing the beautiful Klitorek website (Klitorek is some kind of loose Netlabel, run by Marow and Olaf Tonstein), I found myself a bit disappointed by Marow’s EP “+”. But everytime I saw the cover pic browsing through my MP3-folders, I listened to his music and finally got into it.There is a certain 90’s feel about “+”. Marow combines the classic minimalist approach of Pole and Kraftwerk with a rather romantic idea of harmony and micro-tuning to be found at Turner or early Autechre. Deep in dub, Marow’s sound is special because he is clever enough to use the reverb with care. The frosted echo chambers which use to bore me so much are missing here. Check the hypnotic Ambient piece, the elegant Minimal House of “Und”, the harmony-blessed “Addition” or “Positiv” for its tricky rhythmic entanglements. Another Netaudio release with a similar ominous mood is Direwire &amp; Freder’s “Sleeping near Highways”, and THIS is one of my all-time favourites.MP3 Ambient Music DownloadRelease Site: Marow - “+”Direct Download: Marow - “+” ZIPNetlabel: www.klitorik.com",

            "content": "Run for Cover No. 3 // Phlow Magazine launches a new series dedicated to the art of Netaudio: “Run for Cover”. In bulk sequence, wonderful artworks will be presented and discussed. Number three is the outstanding textural and graphical art for Mickey Eats Plastic’s Remix EP “To Kill The White Glamour” as reviewed in January.The cover artwork was crafted by Matias Conduri, a scribble artists and graphic designer from the city of Buenos Aires, Argentina. Upon a mild grey cardboard surface, black and red strokes are entangled in manifold convulsion. Most dashes from a loose cross. The whole set of lines is concentrated in the middle of the picture with the main part of strokes in black color. Red comes in front the upper left. Apparently, there seem to be two layers: thin lines beneath, dashes more thick and long above. Some kind of a signature (?) can be found in the clew, untouched by any other line.What I like best of Matias’ art is the situation of apparently precise graphic elements into a scruffy cardboard-context. Here, the hand-drawn strokes and crosses function as some kind of reference to typical postmodernist graphic design with it’s polished surfaces, highlights and smooth Apple-style shadings. Apart from any intertextual brown fields, his designs are analog imitations of digital achievements, created to bring joy to your eyes solely.Still, Matias is a good designer the classical way- his artwork would have been beautiful and worth a feature without the aspects of analogism innit. This point convinced me finally to write about his cover for Mickey Eats Plastic rather than another fine piece of Netaudio art I had in mind: Processing’s selftitled EP for the Resting Bell-Netlabel.

The whole compilation is separated into four sub-compilations with the names of the four seasons of a year. I picked out the winter-collection because I enjoy sometimes music-collages with lots of samples and fine breakbeats. And the “Winter”-compilation - where the whole project started with - is a fabolous mix of Hip Hop and experimental downbeats fused together into a heavy mix.If your ears are thirsty for some heavy Hip Hop-beats plus intelligent raps “52 Weeks - Winter” is a good choice to explore some new songs. Like a Hip Hop-mixtape beats, rhymes and effects are melted together. This was possible because the heads behind Peppermill Records coordinated the compilation with care and an interesting approach:  The first artist started on the 21st of December, the first day of Winter which also happens to be the Solstice. They borrowed a headline out of that week’s news as the title to their 2-3 minute song and then had 7 days to complete it before they passed their creation on to the next artist, who continued where they had left off.So just lend your ear for example Cactus On Fire feat. Baba Brinkman. Nice Phlow, thick groove! Or listen to the funny opener with a ton of samples build around an abstruse news-story: “Squishing Sniffy - Artists Busted!”.

For instance: Was it a big scene? How did people find out about it? How did you get involved? Were the participants mostly musicians - or did non-musicians use it to find music as well? How did it actually work?                  &lt;img class=\"left\" src=\"http://phlow-magazine.com/images/vince-fugere-camomille-netl.jpg\"                          Vince: I started being in contact with the BBS (Bulletin Board System) scene back in 1994-1995. Back then an internet connection was pretty much out of the question and it only started getting some media attention.                          It all started for me when a friend of mine invited me to connect to another friend's computer using my really high-speed 14.4 dialup modem to play games on his computer. He had created an interface where we could browse his \"site.\" It was all done in ANSI/ASCII interfaces and there was a spot to download music and images, and also a forum to chat. Only 2 users could be on it at any time. It is back then that I got my first contact with my passions for graphic design and music.                          There was an art-form unfamiliar to most now which is ANSI art. Back then, the DOS interface we used to connect to BBSs was 16 colors, if I remember correctly. Some early graphic artists used this extremely limited set of colors to create absolutely beautiful renderings. From that first BBS you connect then you can see the other BBSs in your area code in the links section.                          I started researching this intriguing ANSI art and found that some artists had created groups from which they published Artpacks. One very popular group back in the day was ICE. What was great is that in order that your local BBS have these files and artpacks and updates from these Artgroups, they had to connect to other BBSs way outside your area code, and the distribution of new files was made this way. Hence the feeling of an underground community we all felt while connecting to BBSs.                        /images/camomille-portrait-1.jpg\" Design &amp; Artwork taken from comic book by Selfmademusic                          On those artpacks, you could find ANSI art, poetry and weird files that had weird extensions, like .mod, .s3m, .xm and .it. After some research I found \"players\" for those kind of files and to my amazement they were music modules. A module, basically, is a file that is somewhat like a .midi file or a sequence file from your favorite sequencer, but that can play only .wav samples that are imbedded in the file itself. There were different reasons for this. From what I know, the tracker (music software) in various forms, was used to create the music found in Amiga and nintendo or any early game system because the filesize was so small. For early nintendo games, well most games anyways, you only had to store 4 really small wav files (a sine wave, a square wav and 2 noise samples for example) and use them in different ways to create sound. Hence the chipmusic scene that is still pretty huge and still getting bigger to this day. This small file size was perfect for the BBS, with out 14.4, it was hell to download .mp3s.&lt;/div&gt;                                                             /images/camomille-portrait-2.jpg\" Design &amp; Artwork by Adnan-Alin Vasile &amp; Felix Petrescu                                              Vince: I remember downloading my first mp3, an Eric Clapton track, and it took me 4 hours to download it with its impressive 4.5 mo, while a chiptune most of the time only weighs about 64 kilobyte. I fell in love with this filetype and started looking around for it on local BBSs. I remember groups like Martyr, N.o.i.s.e., Five Musicians and more. Then I got Impulse Tracker, a newer generation of tracker in which you could pull more tricks and have a wider reach musically and technically, and I started to do some modules.                                          All this was called \"the demoscene\" back then, for a simple reason. These artgroups used to create (and still do) what we call Demos, which is basically a music video, all done in hard coding and using module music as its soundtrack. You can still find some great Demos on www.scene.org.                                          There is another whole history of demos and demogroups, but from what I gather is they started with Cracktros, which is a little video the early crackers of programs used to put in there cracked software .zips. Then the internet came and the module world took the step to the internet. And that's when the netlabel scene was born. But they weren't aware yet, what they created.                                            /images/camomille-portrait-6.jpg\" Design &amp; Artwork by 143                                              The first center that was created for the BBS-turn internet module groups was scene.org, that hosted a selected number of modules. At that time filesize was still very important, so all you could download from the sites were next-generation module files like .it and .xm. I remember going everyday to sites like n.o.i.s.e. music, KFMF, monotonik, tokyo dawn records, total eclipse, five musicians, and in time, hellven, fromage, rebound, mephtik, tpolm. As the years went by, trackers weren't doing chip anymore, but using complex time signatures, higher quality samples and exploring different styles, which in my mind, I have the arrogance to say created IDM. But that's a different story *smile*.                                          The community grew larger everyday, thanks to scene.org, nectarine radio (a radio that played modules live), mirc and traxinspace.com. For a long a ring of tracker groups that released free modules. I can't say who exactly started posting .mp3 music, but if I recall, it would be between miasmah, mono and nashmeja. As we all got better connections, the module started to die out and hence, when the group owners stop calling their organisations music groups or tracker groups, the name netlabel surfaced.                                          There are many reasons why .mp3 took over, but to put it simply: the musicians wanted to record real synthesizers, vocals, live guitars, etc. and the module started to weigh more in module format than mp3 and new programs and sequencers showed up, namely Buzztracker, cubase, reason and logic.                                          I started Camomille in 2001, at the end of the module buzz and decided to go full swing on .mp3 probably around release number 13.                                                                              /images/camomille-portrait-5.jpg\"                                  Phlow: Obviously the current netlabel-scene enjoys a lot of technical advantages over the BBS scene. It also seems that there is a more more developed structure. And, indeed, a lot of folks are looking at ways of developing that structure further. There's Mike Gregoire's article \"An infrastructure for take-over\", for instance, in which he proposes some ways of increasing the netlabel scene's popularity among music listeners. But as someone who both participated in the BBS scene and runs a netlabel, do you feel that anything has been lost as things have become more codified? Are there positive aspects of the BBS scene that you think have failed to translate to the netlabel scene of today?                                              Vince: I love that free music is getting more and more popular and more and more sought after, don't get me wrong, but the state of the current netlabel scene sure does have a lot to envy to the early tracker days. I mean I remember chatting with friends and the scene actually had legends and heroes, like xerxes, purple motion, necros, etc. There was a real following and every time someone released something it was a really exciting time. Now the scene is flooded with netlabels and releases, it's so hard to keep up that people don't have that passion anymore. I mean sure it's still exciting when one of the big netlabels release something. But but good music gets lost in the myriad of releases you see each day.                                          And I'm pretty sure there's great music in there too. We need a central, other than archive.org - which is amazing but its just a hosting platform, not a place where you can easily find good quality music, we need reviews and articles like you guys are doing. A place where everyone from the netlabel world can meet and chat. Sure there are a good couple of newsblogs but again it's hard to keep up with them. I rarely get excited anymore to anything that's being released, just for the simple fact that I don't know where to look anymore, there's just too much.&lt;/div&gt;                                       /images/camomille-portrait-4.jpg\" Design &amp; Artwork by 143                                                  Phlow: How did you come to start camomille? And where do you think camomille fits in with the current scene?                                                                  Vince: Well, the idea made its way back in the end of 2001. I was in a deep depression and after taking drugs which made me feel nothing; my doctor suggested I could maybe drink Camomille tea. And I started doing so. So late at night I was having panic attacks and I started drinking camomille tea listening to Chimera's \"A long way from heaven\" (released on Hellven) and I can say that Camomille tea and Chimera's emotional ambient music actually saved my life. So realizing the importance of music, the importance of ambient music and the importance of free music, I decided to start camomille music, a place where, originally, you could find deep, emotional ambient music.                                                          Camomille at the beginning, was a newbie netlabel but as time passed I got more and more people on it with some recognition, especially from the older tracker scene like xerxes, mv and later mikael fyrek, makunouchi bento, grandma etc.                                                          So I'm starting to think that at number 100, Camomille has made its dent into the scene and it's a testament that Camomilles there to stay. We offer an honest ecclecticism, that I think our fanbase appreciates. Personally, looking back and looking at it now, I couldn't be happier, and I feel more like someone who operates a machine in the sense that camomille kind of became its own entity.&lt;/div&gt;                                                   Phlow: It must be really rewarding to see camomille have come so far. What's the 100th release going to be?                                                                                      Vince: We've just released camomille 100 and I must say it's been a lot of hard work and I'm very, very proud of what it is. Lackluster, Twerk, Proswell, Khonnor, Ilkae, Julien Neto, Hunz, ST, Anders Ilar are just a few of the names on there and they're all people I deeply respect and of who I'm a big fan. And that goes for everyone on the compilation. And for the first time we've added the graphic design side to it, showcasing 13 different artists with their takes on \"Cycles.\"&lt;/div&gt;                                                               Phlow: Finally, what advice would you give to someone who's just starting a net-label?                                                                                                          Vince: As far as advice, I'd say, do it for fun, and be sure to release something that you love, not that you like, not that you feel is mediocre, but the artist carries some weight on whatever's left of this scene. Passion always brings good things and if you always stay pertinent you'll eventually get a following of fans just as dedicated to the music you release as you are.&lt;/div&gt;                                                                           Phlow: Thank you very much for the interview!

            "content": "Calm and Soothing Textures // Under the name of Biathalon, NYC-based Eric Adrian Lee composes smooth organic Ambient music that continuously oscillates from analog to digital. Inspired by equally sky and sea, Eric delivers mesmerizing textures and meditatively meandering synthlines that make you forget time and space.I was wondering how Eric might achieve the specific Biathalon-sound. All his synths and field-recordings sound a bit like wrapped in wool and the melodies shift in tone like molten cassettes. Imagine a broken tape deck under a blanket, playing Brian Eno and Cluster-tunes. And indeed: all his music is recorded on an old cassette multitracker, as he told me when I got in contact with him, asking about the music. Cool.The EP starts with the lulling “Warm Front”. Though it’s very harmonic, a feeling of subtle menace remains… The song captures the feeling of “calm before the storm” quite perfect. For “Neumayer Station” and “Cloud Formation”, Eric gets close to the Boards of Canada. With it’s minimal oscillations, tiny pitches and overall fluctuation, particularly “Cloud Formation” is more than just copying the Boards’ trademark-sound… Eric Satie comes to my mind, and again, Eno.“Program Information” comes off with a nice set of retro-futuristic synth sounds and gently shifts the atmosphere from sky high to underwater… to bring it all down in the epic 16 minutes-track “Underwater Is A Place To Be Alone”. Being the most traditional song on this EP says a lot about Biathalon herein. Pure calm, Eric skillfully combines water sounds, aquanaut breath, smooth rhodes chords and gentle guitar-improv.

            "content": "Timeless Eloquent House // The sound of Epsilonlab is lush, deep, melodic, dubby and techy. You find the spirit of house-music in every release. With great musicians like Paul Keeley, Pheek, Eloi Brunelle or Sensual Physics Epsilonlab published some of the finest house-music released under a cc-licence. Even if Epsilonlab is a little quiet right now, we can state, that the Epsilonlab Collective is without any doubt one of the first professional netlabels. Epsilonlab grew suddenly out of the ground, we raised our hands frenetic in the air and embraced than the beautfiful sounds from Canada.Subhead //Vincent Casanova- “Take Me Beyond (Paul Keeley Remix)” (MP3)Sensual Physics - “Cold Sweat” (MP3)The canadian netlabel Epsilonlab has quite well-known producers on its roster like Paul Keeley, Eloi Brunelle, Pheek, Sensual Physics or Jeff Benett. Somehow I think the sound is best described as friendly. While the heart is full of love for house-music, the production of most of the releases sound digital and most of the time crystal clear.One of my favorite musicians on Epsilonlab is Paul Keeley. Paul Keeley who did also the mastering for a lot of releases on Epsilonlab produces colorful TechHouse-Music. With each release he convinced me again that he is a master of melodic TechHouse tunes with a slight trance-approach. To discover the sound of Paul Keeley you have to begin with his beautiful live-act-mix “Paul Keeley - Live @ Elektra, QC”. Than dig deeper into the archive.One of my favorite netlabel-tracks to date is still the amazing “Cold Sweat” from Sensual Physics aka digitalverein aka Joerg Schuster. Don’t miss the according “Expanding Itself” EP with four fine tracks hard to define.To make my bunch complete, check out Eloi Brunelle. Eloi is the head behind the netlabel, the man who helds it all together. Even if his musical approach is slightly harder and techno his beloved brother, he expands the Epsilonlab Music-Archive with straight forward productions for clubheads. Yet his weird, humurous track called “My Submarine” together with Vanessa Moore on “Psychotonic EP” is still my favorite.Videoclip “Spaceball” by Fukkle Bim JerryLately the german blogger, experimentalist and netaudio musiclover Janos Krüger aka Fukkle Bim Jerry sent me his beautiful little videoclip called “Spaceball”. He choosed the Epsilonlab track “On The Stone” from Black Foundation Dub E.P. by Mossa as the musically counterpart for his pictures. The videoclip shows how you can combine a 99cent-toy for children with good music with some smart video-editing. Everything was released under a creative commons.

The mysterious G-Love takes you back to the old days where the crowds shook their bodies frenetic at the Berlin Love Parade.

Ah, and did I mention the Remix-Package which invites musicians to make a remix?I like good stories whether they are true or not. If I read the funny description about the “Teddy Bear”-release and how the music found its way to Top40-Netlabel, I get a little bit suspicious. Is it true, that some unknown producer from Dresden send these solid dancefloor-smash-hits to the russian netlabel? Was he really an active member of rave movement in the middle of 90’s? And did he really start again to make music after 10 years of absence?!?Nothing of that matters because these tracks are great. Great if you like some odd-vocals like “I Got You Under My Skin”, “The Flavour of the Drive” or “You Feel The Drive” along with a powerful and catchy Techno-production with some Pop in it. Especially “Flavour of z drive” reminds me a little bit of these awful Scooter-Tracks with way too much pathetic vocals. But check out “Superstar” or the humorous track “Teddy Bear”.

            "content": "Run for Cover No. 2 // Multimedia-Cover-Artworks are the appropriate format for virtual music-releases. Especially the file-format Flash has the potential to reanimate the now dying cover-artwork of physical releases. It’s hard to understand that nearly no label nor musician distributes multimedia-artworks along with their music-releases. With the possibilities of programming the “cover-artwork”, the offering to include multimedia-files like video-clips and the chance to communicate via your artwork with the musiclover, I scratch my head and ask for more interactive flash-covers. That’s why I love the design of the artworks on -N netlabel. Simply because they are the first step towards a new way of artworks for the digital century.I truly love some of the flash-cover-artworks you find on minusn.com. Often inspired by manga you can take a relaxed look and find fine details. Like in the wonderful animation above. At first sight you won’t see the feet because the swimming and moving fish attracts your attention. Also I like the steady waterflow. It gives the image somehow a time-component and time seems to smoothly passing by.The original image and flash-artwork was done syun osawa and you find the according release on minusn.com/en/mn004.html.Interactive Flash-Cover-ArtworkAnother small masterpiece is the flash-cover-artwork for the -N release “picnic plan ep” by masaya sasaki. The original artwork was done by poeyama and comes along with a series of flash-movies. If you move the mouse over the artwork, something interesting will happen and you’ll suddenly see lightning.This sort of flash-cover-artworks interacts with the listener/consumer. As an artist flash-cover-artworks give you the chance to communicate with your audience. You can update information in your flash-covers via internet, or offer a contact-form. You can integrate videos, text, pictures and lots of different information about you, your netlabel and especially about your art. Please produce more amazing flash-cover-artworks and see them as an intelligent form of EPK (electronic press kit).From ASCII-Art to Flash-Cover-ArtworkThe music in our podcast comes from Dataman and his release “the most famous heroes ep”.

In bulk sequence, wonderful artworks will be presented and discussed. Number one is the disturbing and beautiful cover for GoGooo’s “La Forét aux Petites Filles” EP from 2006.GoGooo is Gabriel Hernandez, a shy Frenchman from the city of Grenoble. Talking about music, he is well-known for his releases at EKO, Zymogen and his own Netlabel Rain Music. Furthermore, “commercial” releases at Baskaru and mOAR are on the list. Due to his musical activities, Hernandez creates impressionist comics and comic-influenced paintings. Together with his brother Nicolas, they publish a nice photocopy magazine of underground comics and scribble art called JETS.The Artwork of “La Forét aux Petites Filles” for the Mexican Ambient Netlabel Mandorla is created be Gabriel Hernandez himself. The simple b/w drawing shows an unnatural long-haired girl, crouched in the midst of the picture. Like water, her massive black hair flows to the lower right. Hair and water are common elements in Japanese horror, and this figure is probably influenced by certain Yūrei-images. In contrast to the unsettling presence of the girl, a light rose bubble surrounds the name of artist and album, displayed in comic-style letters.Despite the obvious aesthetic reasons, this discrepancy is the most notable thing about Hernandez’ drawing. Unerring in choice of color and composition (note how the bubble resembles the silhouette of the ghost-girl), Gabriel Hernandez manages to leave the spectator in awe and creeps at the same time. Finally, GoGooo’s rich textured Ambient music creates a very similar feel and is the perfect content for this outstanding Netaudio artwork herein.",

Most of the Friends Requests® I use to get are pure rubbish, but every now and then talented musicians dare to be heard. I the case of Gillicuddy, artist-name and album- title didn’t made me expect too much. Still, after the first few tones of this tiny EP I knew Gillicuddy would be worth to be heard by a greater audience.East Frisia-born Andreas Rohden aka Gillicuddy spices his compositions with a lot of references to seafaring and life at the seaside in general. For “It This Greenland Already”, Rohden sings emphatic and slightly shiftless over raw guitar-chords, shifting from bare-to-the-bone Bluesrock to Avant-Garde Pop and vice versa. Afterwards “Agrippa’s Trilemma” begins quite similar but fades into field-recordings just as one would expect the chorus to pop in. Cool maneuver, made me think of Gastre del Sol. “One Day in the Life of Shmallhans” after the smooth instrumental “Hallig” is a creaking waltz and drunken shanty. Rohden layers his different vocal identities above each other and manages to create an authentic honky-tonk feel.Gillicuddy’s EP “Shmallhans is Kuechemeister” refers to an old German saying that is used if there’s no food left in the kitchen and “Slender Hans is Chef”. As quaint as the title, Rohden voices his grumpy Folk-tunes with a good amount of humor though his music ain’t good-humored. That’s a rare and dangerous move as serious listeners might feel rejected by Rohden’s geek humor.

            "content": "Interview with the italian Dharmasound Netlabel // Over the past couple of years, the Rome-based net-label dharmasound has put out nearly forty first-rate releases covering a wide range of music. Last Fall, Gianluigi Cocco - dharmasounds’ general manager and artistic director - was kind enough to take some time to talk a bit about the label, their philosophy of music, and their place in the net-label scene. Dave Kneifer talked for Phlow with the labelhead.      Interview done by Dave Keifer who does odd jobs for Dog Eared Records and releases music as Cagey House.  Phlow: Dharmasound has a really sharp website. It’s well organized, has a clean design, and a cool look. What kind of web design or technical advice would you give to somebody who was thinking of starting a netlabel?      Cocco: Actually we are working on the new website and it will be very innovative: we are trying to conceive a \"visual\" virtual place without any conventional web layout. Our goal is to let users feel comfortable with navigation and, mainly, give them a nice relaxing virtual environment. A netlabel-website is the \"window on the real world\" so it has to be very representative and give users a large number of services like streaming, previews, news, music-files in different format and different quality and, very important, a well organized catalog. For a netlabel like dharmasound.com who has a multi-genre catalog, it's a priority to offer users a support to quickly navigate through releases and genres. We are now working on this particular issue and the new website will have a new catalog navigations logic based upon environments and colours.  Phlow: You provide a means for a lot of interactivity as well. On the message boards, for instance, people can upload demos and news about releases and live dates. I think this kind of thing is one of the real advantages netlabels have over traditional label, which is that they can serve as a hub for a virtual - or even a physical community. Which raises my next questions: Did dharmasound grow out of an already existing community? Or do you feel that you’ve helped to create a new community?      Cocco: Dharmasound started out in 2005 from a small group of artists based in Italy. At that particular time we built up a small site with few releases and 4 or 5 visitors per day :-). In these two years we grew up in terms of catalog, artists, listeners and we also started a message board called dharmaboard which is our place to share free music, demos, informations and experiences with people, musicians and other netlabels. I's slowly growing up and I think it will give a good help to diffuse independent music released under Creative Commons License.  Phlow: I see that this past August you guys hosted a live event at a club in Rome that featured five dharmasound artists. How did that go? And do you plan on more in the future?      Cocco: I think live events are the \"core\" of a netlabel activity. Artists need to get out from the web to meet audience. OUTPUT event was a sort of introduction to dharmasound's music and it was a good opportunity to let people know that other music distribution models are possible. We are planning to increase our live activities and we're trying to involve other netlabels into a project that could be described as a sort of \"international booking network.\"  Phlow: Dharmasound has always focussed mostly Creative Commons tracks - free downloads in other words. But for a while you also had some tracks for sale–although you seem to have discontinued that. I was wondering why you no longer have the for-sale tracks? And also what your ideas are about net-labels as potential money-making operations?      Cocco: It was a sort of experiment. Almost one year ago we decided to ask users a donation for each download. Our goal was to cover web hosting costs and share the profits with artists. Obviously all the tracks were released under CC license and everyone was able to freely share music bought at dharmasound.com, in other words it was a sort of \"donation\" or \"contribution\" rather than a traditional selling. But, though the price was very low (€ 0.50 per track), unfortunately the experiment was unsuccessful so we decided to go back to the roots: free download of all our releases!          We have to realize that we aim towards a different kind of \"market\" completely free and innovative, traditional distribution models are quickly dying and we have the great opportunity to build something new. I think at the moment netlabels are only able to earn money from the live activity organization. That's it. No sponsorships, sellings or wathever until we'll get bigger and we'll offer high-quality catalogs.  Phlow: Finally, what’s been your favorite experience while running dharmasound?      Cocco: The greatest experience was to meet interesting people (artists, musicians, collaborators). People from all over the world with completely different cultures and backgrounds. Let me give a big thanks to some of them: Stefano who was our artistic director since last month, Mari our graphic designer (I definitely love her works), Luca, Francesco and Alfredo who recently joined our staff doing a great work.

Roy John, Lachlan Carrick, Dan West and Christopher Hale did a great job to accompany their stylish songstress. Together we nod to their heavy beats, the grumbling bass and the melancholic sounds. Or get freaky to the dark vibes of the drum’n’bass “Resonate”. Delicious!What I like so much about “Songbox”, is the fact that you discover all these reminiscences to different styles of music. Be it Dub, Reggae, Hip Hop or Drum’n’Bass: the australian Trip Hop Band manages to mix their influences smartly together and it works. It’s a little miracle how all these influences come together to present us a delicate EP from beginning to end.The only downside of “Songbox” is that we still miss a follow-up.

Situated between LA and Kyoto, equipped with a certain focus on Folk and Pop, Soto took a good step towards traditional song-structures, slightly moving away from pure sound design and tapestry.Actually, there is a rather big amount of Westcoast-Pop within this tiny EP. “My Blue Plane”, the last of the four tunes, brings forth a strong Beach Boys flavor, dressed in an introvert shoegaze outfit. Simon &amp; Garfunkel came to my mind, too. You can’t beat beauty, that’s a fact, no matter how many generations passed! Make sure to catch all the little noise, flutes, guitar and vocal-layers… stunning, ethereal.But there are three more songs to be heard. The opener “Playful Day” is a Animal Collective-style meditation on delay and reverberated clusters of guitar, just fine. “Only Star” comes off as a surprising mixture of smooth Jazz-vocals (Japanes language), chamber Pop and loose snippets of rhythm. The violin introduced here is more prominent deployed in the third tune “Orange”. A sweet and innocent Pop-song with melodica, strings and fine guitars-noise in the back, super.The haunting artwork was done by Ryoko Uchida (no infos though…).MP3 Pop Music DownloadDirect Download: Soto - “Soto EP” ZIPNetlabel: www.creation-centre.com**Artist Website:** www.otosound.net",

Lagàr and Antani, as they call themselves, met in 2005 and immediately found their talents for atmosphere and melody (Antani) and straightforward beats (Lagàr) mixing up to something special. Did I mention we’re talking about dope instrumental Hip Hop? Drop your knees for the Apes.Apes on Tapes - “Da Try Bute” (MP3)Fresh, Fresh, Superfresh! Their full length debut after an EP in early 2006 is brilliant from top to bottom. With Prefuse 73 and Dabrye as the main contemporary influences in the back, the Apes on Tapes add a good amount of Popappeal to their idea of Hip Hop. Nearly every song has a catchy melody, crisp beat or uncommon element to attend to. “Even If” for example has a warm 70’s sound due to the recycled Soul-sample. In concert with cut-up vocals, J. Dilla has to be mentioned as an additional reference. The hit single and opening track is “Catkilla”. Carefully entangled guitars, a smooth-but-tight beats, everything’s just in place. “Grand 5” has a similar feel and makes your head nod with a melodious piano-loop instead of guitar licks. So good!On the more abstract, minimal side, “Da Try Brute” and especially the way-out “Limone Nel West” left me stunning. At “Light Dry But Creamy” and “Sleep Soon, Wake Up Soon”, Lagàr and Antani fuse tricky IDM-style beats with smooth ambient textures and beautiful piano loops. Awesome!

Ivan Kapec (electric guitar and electronics), Andrej Jakuš (trumpet, flugelhorn and electronics) and Janko Novoselić (drums).Their music is vivid, sometimes hard to catch in the first moment but always on point. Along with effects from dub to sampled loops TrianguliZona produce music in the tradition of modern jazzers like Bugge Wesseltoft or Nils Petter Molvaer. Enjoy this complex and live improvisations with progressive electric guitar, jazz trumpet with pedal and electronic effects.

The festival is hosted and organized by New York City’s finest 8bit Peoples Netlabel and gets together the world elite of chip sound since 2006 (not sure about that). Now, for the 2008s edition of Blip, the infamous 2Player Productions made up an extremely professional and dedicated documentation of the whole 8bit scene, listed for the SXSW Film Festival: “Reformat the Planet”. A good moment to introduce some key players.First of all, check the trailer:Wow! This is exactly the tool, a brewing subculture needs to gain attention from the mainstream. At least a greater audience in case you deny the term “mainstream”. Awesomely well produced, funny, cool and informative. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen the whole thing… Nevertheless, fingers crossed for the SXSW from the whole Phlow Mag crew!While the 8bit Peoples provide the world with free music, 2Player Productions stream music- and live-videos of the protagonists via vimeo.com (  you already know the mash-up clip for Anamanaguchi. I choose a couple of videos to give you an idea of the 2PP style, starting with 8bit Peoples mastermind Joshua Davis aka Bit Shifter. Chip Cruise Ahoy!I have mentioned Random in the introduction, here’s a cool video of this young Swedish 8bit raver:Most chip heads are solo artist, rocking the stage solely with Gameboy, C64 or MacBook. The Depreciation Guild is a Rock band rather than the typical Electronica stage act. Some kind of NYC 8bit poster boys, actually. Skinny guys with rampage guitars and NES-keyboards, how does this work? Assure yourself right here.Another special thing in the chip scene is being female. Here, Korea-born Haeyoung Kim aka Bubblyfish is one of my favorite 8bit musicians. Her style is a bit more academic, less hedonistic than the average chip party outlet. Make sure to check her album at Burkhard Kerlin’s Retinascan-label!To make you book the tickets to New York City and fall in love with the chips finally, enjoy this powerful live performance of Jeremiah Johnson aka Nullsleep. Another important 8bit Peoples-head, Johnson is the dark messiah of chip music. Striking stage presence combined with belief, Nullsleep might be the one to read about in your favorite music magazines at first. The 2PP spring for the moving pictures:At www.2playerproductions.com there are a lot more cool video to watch. What clips are your favorites? What important artists haven’t been mentioned and deserve our attention? Please post!",

            "content": "Instrumental Electronic Pop from Russia // On “A&amp;M” you listen to the beautiful cooperation of eletronic musician Nick Zavriev aka Ambidextrous and Sergey Moskovkin aka Morkva. Together they composed relaxed eletronic music somewhere above the clouds. With kind-hearted tunes and a little bit of kitsch you feel like resting in a nice lounge.One of my favorite songs is the pop-orientated “In”. With its enthusiastic mood you keep rolling on a big wave of positive vibes made out of synthesizer-melodies and Sergey Moskovkin fluffy guitarplay. His skillful guitar play gives the full-synthesized music a perfect human touch which saves the album to be just another electronic music production.The only downside of the album is the sometimes missing experimentation with synthesizer sounds. Some sounds like in “Final Cut” sound to much like factory-presets and give some songs a slight superficial note. A little bit more courage next time and we have an all-time favorite. Nevertheless you get an album worth listening which combines cleverly electronic music like IDM with a soft rock guitar. Just try “Organica”, “In” and “Nova”.MP3 Electronic Pop Music DownloadRelease-Website: www.netaudio.ru/electrosound/releases/es39/Netlabel: www.netaudio.ruDownload @ Archive.org: Ambidextrous / Morkva - A&amp;M (ZIP)",

For his collection “Three Soundscapes”, Smallwood and the Now Ensemble gathered to perform three of his most accessible compositions up to date. Neo-classical Ambient at the edge of Noise and Musique Concrète that might mark a good starting point for those who dare to dig deeper.The album starts with “Colton Swarm”. 11:30 minutes mainly build of harmonica- and cello-drones. Enhanced with subtle field-recordings, the whole piece billows up and down, gives rise to noisy wave peaks, uncovers calm clearings and stomachs the careless listener in a whole. Huge. “Stay” is the very step too close to Industrial-music and, although the end is fine, not my cup of machine oil.So skip and enjoy “Still in Here”. For another 10:40 minutes, Smallwood and the Now Ensemble carefully create advanced, acoustic ambient music. Sijis Netlabel put Smallwood’s musical annotations in the ZIP-file and it’s pretty exciting to follow them. All musicians act with great concentration and intuition for each other.

With Applexjux I enjoy an excellent choice of good creative commons music. Just listen for example to the fade over from ambient music to the reggae-track with Mickey Murka: Perfect! From one moment to the other the mastermind of op3n lets us slide from an sweet ambient tune into the wonderful world of dub.Also in the second halftime he manages one more time to push us from one genre into the other. While resting on downbeats, we suddenly head for the the dancefloor to dance to a 4-to-the-floor beat. But you won’t be surprised because Applejux prepared everything with care as I told you before.

Beginning with an atmospheric soundtrack-like song the album opens up to bring us more and more different musical aspects of Guy Andrews music project.You listen to slow and calm songs like “When Father Cries” full of melancholy, you listen to voices like in “Night 13” getting uplifted or you dream while hovering over a cineastic soundtrack like “December’s Shadows”. Listening to “As The Snow Fell” is like reading a poetic story full of subtle changes which take you far, far away into an admiring world.

His choice of Folk-influenced electronic music is stunning, and the Belgian Kaboom Karavan-collective was totally new to me. Fortunately, the full-length record keeps the promise a single tune made up.      Kaboom Karavan is mainly Bram Bosteels. For his adventurous Free Folk music, Bosteels regularly gets together with his friends, situated in “a very small town in a rather small country”, like he notes on his myspace account. Sounds pretty much like a collective-thing going on, and if you take the open structure of his songs, the high amount of processing and all these jingle bells in account, a certain esoterism-charge might be appropriate.But Kaboom Karavan have good songs. “Karavanserai”, “No More Karavan” and especially “Short Walk with Olaf” are awesomely loose pieces of Blues- and Americana-influenced Post Pop, “Roadmap” is a brilliant composition of ambient and fractal Folk-pickings. After all, “Toambertree”, with it’s electronic basement more evident, manages to join Free Folk and aggressive Breakbeats surprisingly well. Carefully produced, this album would have been a good hit for Kranky or Constellation records.

I got to know about him thanks to Heezen’s recent mixtape at Audiotalaia, which incorporates one of his tunes (and is a wonderful listen in a whole, btw). For his album, Portabot created a carefully rounded down mixture of processed guitars, ambient synth-textures and a lot of in-between.      Actually, I tried to convince Cesar Pesquera to give his album a proper release at 12rec. but he didn’t dare to respond. So, because I don’t want anyone to miss this gem, I advice you to get your lazy fingers over to Last.fm and play the right-click-save-as game for the twelve songs of “There Must Be a Sunrise in Every Ending”.The overall atmosphere of the LP is very dense, potentially melodic and capable of letting you drop your head to the desktop and dream off. Think of Tim Hecker, think of Four Tet. I did experience something similar for Netaudio-artists like 1.000 Hours of Staring, Herzog and especially Neuf Meuf, all of these who are among my absolute favorites. Songs to take a first glance at are “Liverpool”, “Sorry” or “Relief”. It’s confusing some of the tunes end with sudden cuts and I’d like to have these discussed with Pesquera, but well… let’s be grateful we’re able to download them after all!MP3 Electronica Music DownloadRelease-Site: Portabot - “There Must Be a Sunrise in Every Ending”Artist Website: www.portabot.netNote added in prove: The album’s been re-released eventually.

Lots of needless pictures and styles have been deleted and the xhtml-code behind the website looks more streamlined and clearly arranged - but that’s for nerds, I guess.Upcoming Next: More insights on the musiciainsIn the first phase Brigitte, Sven and I took a deeper listen to music. In the next and upcoming phase we want to try to publish interviews and portraits of musicians who release their music under a creative commons or for free. Here in germany there isn’t nearly any coverage of musicians from netlabels. That’s bad, we think. So prepare for some serious interviews and portraits of netlabels, producers and creative commons activists.Sometimes we ask ourselves: “Where’s all the cover-artwork gone?!?” That’s why, we will spend in the next months also a look on well-designed netlabels and of course breath-taking release-artworks. Sven and I love to take a look on artworks and we enjoy interesting artworks.Last not lease there are some Phlow-Compilations and Phlow-Netaudio-Mixes coming up. Thanks to the creative commons licences compilations are an easy way to handle.The future looks bright, stay with us and enjoy some really great music :)",

They organise their netlabel from Hungary and distribute Techno, Minimal, Trance, House and Electronica under three sub-channels called Ae-Tech, Ae-Min, and Ae-Deep. While listening to several of their releases I digged deeper into the mini-techno-compilation called “Viva La Fuerza”, a compilation of minimal techno and trance.Dorian Knox “Butterfly” (MP3)Sometimes I wonder who listens to dark techno tracks like I found on Audioexits sublabel Ae-Tech. These badass tracks kick fast and deep, but any interesting groove and twist is missing. I used to dance to such streamlined tracks in my youth, today I scratch my neck how I could provide enough energy to dance to such music for even half an hour.No surprise, I found myself listening to the deeper and more minimal tracks lending the sublabel Ae-Min an ear. Even in this subcategory the hungarian tracks sound dark and push with an extra-portion of subbass. But nevertheless the fat production kick you constantly and especially the trance-influenced “Butterfly” by Dorian Knox has potential to get the hands of the clubbers into the air in front of your dj-mixing-desk. Somehow the track reminds me of this trance-megahit “7 Days And One Week”. Of all four tracks “Butterfly” has the most pop-orientated touch and if you like minimal techno, give the whole quality ep a try.MP3 Techno Trance Music DownloadViva La Fuerza EP(AeMin001)Netlabel: www.audioexit.comDownload (ZIP); Various Artists- Viva La Fuerza EP",

Misantroph drops a dark, super-fat track right between the eyes of El-P and DJ Shadow, Aqua Luminus III. (Komaflash-collective) fuses fuzzy guitars, old-school cuts and Def Jux-style keyboards. B-Ju (Frankfurt) delivers an outstanding track that sounds like Dabyre and Diddy teamed up with a string quartet and, finally, J. Baracuz (Berlin) is responsible for the Dilla-credits. Who ever tells you German Hip Hop can’t cope the original- get him into this!

Just right for a cold Winter’s day!Often I wonder why so less musicians care about their artworks. In case of “Distal”, the latest Entia Non-record after two CDRs at U Cover Records (Lackluster, Milieu, Ten &amp; Tracer), Test Tube prove intuition by choosing a photo of a sunlit cornfield. That’s exactly what “Distal” sounds like. James’ multilayer music incorporates many elements and moods, ranging from pulsating calmness (“Burning Back in Vacant Fields”) to medium menace (“Cultural Plagiarism”) and evident beauty (“A Winter Plateau”). Especially in the first half of the album, musicality and experimentalism are in good ratio. As an EP, “Distal” would have been quite perfect; sad enough I can’t avoid to notice that some of the later tunes have a certain tendency to drown in reverb.

Cool.With Ghostape’s African (?) roots, one might expect a voice rather dark in tone. But the vocals you can hear on nearly every song of “We Need Music” sound rather pre-pubertal than stereotype manly. The album is full of bewitching song-scribbles like introvert “Midnight”, the displaced “Silverway” or “Follow Me”. On the other hand, rather up-tempo, anthem-like tunes appear in the mix. Check the crooked Sonic Youth-reference “Wellcome” or “Leave Me Alone” which sounds like the Strokes mad-drunken doing a soundcheck with Peaches.Muji Ghostape creates music that lives from the antagonism between cheap instrumentals and elaborated, often surreal vocal-arrangements.

Spontaneously they teamed up, grabbed some bottles of red wine, enjoyed excellent french food and produced some relaxed sunny dub reggae tunes for us. “Savoir vivre, you know what I’m sayin!?!”While disrupt enjoys putting some good old 8-bit-sounds into his tunes, Bo Marley know how to play their instruments. Together with Volfoniq they complete their sound and while they enjoyed the sun last year down at the côte d’azur at Montpelier, we smile now while listening to the melodic reggae anthems they composed for us.

            "content": "Vespertine Ambient Drones // Ian D. Hawgood is a traveler. He switches from Occident to Orient, living in the UK and Japan, recording music with a four-track machine at the Pacific Ocean or in his London apartment. His huge Ambient Drones carry along memories of American Minimal-Music, roughed up with moments of joyful noise and the fractal remains of analog instruments. There’s a lot of good Ambient-music at the Resting Bell-Netlabel. Christian is releasing a lot, and it’s hard to follow every release, by time. That’s a shame because it happens you miss gems like “The Fires Will Die at Night”.Ian D. Hawgood delivers four long tunes packed with field-recordings, lush synth-pads, hyper-processed guitars, percussion and a lot of other ringing things and instruments. His music is dense and engaging, developing single elements for 17 minutes in particular (“This Night Has Come Too Soon”) without loosing the individual leitmotif. You can let it run in the back, but only if you listen closely you get to the core of Hawgood’s art. Somewhere next to Black Dice, Stars of the Lid and Brian Eno. Watch out for his future releases at Umor Rex, Error Lo-Fi, Smallfish Records and Dog Eared!MP3 Ambient Music DownloadRelease-Site: Ian D.

            "content": "Textures of Beauty // With Marihiko Hara’s “Cesura”, the inerrable Zymogen Netlabel dropped another outstanding Ambient-album. While Takeshi Nakamura, the other Japanese Artist on Zymogen, is commonly known for his razor sharp Digitronica, Marihiko Hara provides his diversified Ambient-textures with rather velvet gloves. Smooth electro-acoustic music with Pop-appeal and relevance? There you go! Alongside Natsuko Yanagimoto, Marihiko is 50% of Experimental Pop-duo Rimacona. Their mixture of Jazz, Electronica and J-Pop is refreshing yet clearly based on Asian and European standards. Without his songstress, Marihiko creates spectacular music that does not know about borders. His texture are rich in sound and harmony, his glitches haven’t been heard before, noise and melody are in perfect balance. It’s difficult to pick certain songs because every one of them deserves attention… maybe you can start with the minimalistic bubbling “Traumfolge”, the epic title track “Cesura”, the piano-ballad “Konstellation” or “Modena” featuring Natsuko Yanagimoto on the mic.

But to make sure not a single one of you misses their latest gift, I’m writing about the self-titled debut album of Japanese piano-player Reiko Matane. Right between introvert Pop, Chamber Music and traces of Electronica, Reiko creates her manifold vision of postmodern piano music. The ultimate richness of the piano has been documented throughout the history of music. Just lately the instrument re-gained attention by contemporary artists like Hauschka, Gonzales or Polly-Jean Harvey. The idea to feature the piano in all it’s diversified aspects is also evident in Reiko Matane’s compositions. You can hear her cloth rustle, nails on the keys, you can follow the hammers beat the strings in a delicate, intimate manner. Reiko’s songs draw influences from Ambient and Electronica (“Kodo”), Shoegaze Pop (“Susu”, “Hashirihaki Suru”) and all along film music, and she manages to make all these sound like fresh and unused. Bewitching. Unmissable.MP3 Piano Music DownloadRelease-Site: Le Mépris - “Le Mépris”Direct Download: Le Mépris - “Le Mépris” ZIPNetlabel: www.aerotone.netArtist Website: www.myspace.com/lmprs",

            "content": "Atmospheric Techno // Cubenx comes from Mexico. Even though the title track “Turquoise” kicks off with a steady bassdrum, his music includes more than a 4-to-the-floor. It seems, that the mexican musician gets inspiration from various sources for his electronic productions. I guess, that’s why you hear next to techno music some deep ambient works. All his five tracks on his “Turquoise” EP are still connected with a melodic feeling for some pop-like grooves.I always enjoy music releases which come along my earphones with different styles. Nothing is more boring than a steadily bouncing bassdrum through a whole ep. That’s why I like Cubenx approach to fuse different music styles together. The music on “Turquoise” ranges from techno to electro to ambient. And it works. His “Turquoise” EP leads us through different moods. When you listen to his ambient track “Calfarsand” it is never too far away from the more upfront electro-track namend “Repeat”. Funky beats, playful sound-experiments and anthem-like synthesizers lift you up in this track. Cool.A well-shaped, vivid and experimental release full of surprises.Last not least, I have somehow this feeling, that Cubenx has a deep connection to music from my hometown Cologne - to be precise to music from Kompakt Records.

Both Netlabels feature challenging (electronic) music from Moscow and Western Russia. Dmitry Drozdov a.k.a. Maguett is part of this young and hungry electronic music-scene. His debut-LP “Ceramicboy” is a trip from IDM to Electronica to instrumental HipHop and similar.Maguett released at Noise-Joy and Clinical Archives to join the ElectroSound Netlabel with his most accessible album up to date. Under the influence of the compilation of three mixtapes he released at Share my Wings (another sprout of the Excentrica empire) recently, “Ceramicboy” sounds a bit like a ‘best of electronic music’-sampler with tracks differing in style and quality. The tracks I like best have a decent HipHop-feel: “Take That” is somewhere between early Autechre and Prefuse 73, “Out Door Experiment” has cool fat synthesizers and a relaxed Boards of Canada-groove. The song you have to check on all account is “Bubbles”: crystal clear electronic HipHop, reduced to the max, with a head nodding beat and microscopic melody. So damn fresh.

With Nick Drake, Van Dyke Parks and Mark Hollis at hand, he chooses the right instruments for every single tune, finds the correct intonation (delicate, yet on point) and knows about the aural space every single element needs to unfold. “Pictures of Trees” and “Decks, Up and Above” are only random examples for the grandezza, Sebastian knows to unleash.“Under the guise of a lo-fi project out of a Brooklyn nook, he writes songs for the allergic. The nose itching from time spent sniffling at odd ball instrumental writing, Sebastian began sneezing out lyrical melody.

Get ready for a 3.7 GB download of the Panda Bear’s US-tour in Summer 2007!The whole tour was filmed by mysterious Mike, “a regular dude who likes to film shows”, as he writes on eartapes.com. On his website, Mikes provides high-quality videos by his favourite bands and musicians. When Mike heard about Panda Bear’s small US tour for his recent album “Person Pitch”, he got in contact with Noah, offering his idea to accompany him for three shows. The Panda Bear agreed and Mike shoulderd his digicam. He shot the shows, backstage material, sound checks and filmed an interview. Back home, Mike cut everything to reasonable length, fixed sound track and subtitles and out the whole thing on his website.It seems like Mike does not want to earn money with his passion because everything is for free: “I am a firm believer that the greatest things in life aught to be free, music being one of those things. Because of this and my respect, appreciation, and gratitude for Panda Bear, there is no necessary charge for this DVD.

Rowan McNaught’s Pop-experiments are worth a listen - though I bet some of you might disagree. The experimental Pop-tunes he releases under the name of Pompey refuse any proper classification. He switches from lo-fi Electroacoustica to Ambient to Avant-Pop like changing your underwear. Connecting element: the sound of the gallon drum.After an EP and a full-length album in 2005, “Fifty Gallon Drum” is the latest record by Pompey. It’s out on Pocketclock Music, a small Australian Netlabel that features The Sound of Young Melbourne. The Music on the new Pompey album is made of uneven rhythmic drum-patterns, gallon drums, synthesizers, some skew vocals and a handful of tiny noises. Less guitars than on the previous releases, Rowan moved his music closer to Fine Arts than Indierock. If a collapsing tower of gaudy building bricks will ever need a soundtrack, it’ll be Pompey. Check the video for “Feet Miniature” for reference:The Pompey songs preserve a strong improvisational sense, they seem like sketches that have been recorded accidentally. Still there a beautiful melodies and structures that justify the drawer Pop music. Some people probably dislike Rowan’s loose tunes.

Processing… choose Frequency Modulation as a strictly synthetic way to produce sounds and textures. One of the most important FM-based synthesizers was the Yamaha DX7, sold in the first half of the 1980’s and mainly responsible for the aseptic Synthpop-sound we fear the decade for. So why does this record sound so damn analogue? “Processing… is about approaching sound and sound-objects in original and unconventional ways”, as we get to know at the Resting Bell website. Michael Dzjaridze from the city of Utrecht created the rich textured and harmonic Ambient drones for the three elongated tracks on his EP with a synthesis approach called Frequency Modulation: simple sine waves are warped by other sine waves. As all sounds can be fit by sine waves, this method sounds quite natural. Still, the outcome usually feels cold and harsh.Dzjaparidze manages to make his FM-tunes sound like a Krautrock-band jamming on Moog and Hammond B3. Get yours ears on the smooth string-sounds at “Gone, But Not Forgotten” and check the delicate organ flicker. Somewhere between Nest, Stars of the Lid and Cluster.

Exclusively for the elegant 1Bit Wonder-Netlabel, Daniel Graumüller and Mario Kreuzer fixed a “Live EP” with five songs from their latest album “Kein Grund Zufrieden zu Sein”. Energetic and a bit nostalgic. The notable thing about Endlos is their non-delusive sense for melodies and the right instrumentation. That is especially true for these five live re-works from their album. Abiding by the motto of 1bit Wonder to bring together electronic and hand-made musicial elements, Endlos stand right between Synthpop and Postrock. I found myself evocative of The Cure, New Order and The Notwist at the same time.“Gestern Warst Du Anders” features a digitally amplified drum-beat, ambient synthesizers, gentle guitars and well-dosed glockenspiel acccents. For the second tune, Graumüller and Kreuzer move a bit closer to the band-sound they present on stage. “Renne Durch Dein Leben” is classic Postrock, hypnotizing and simple, with stoic bass and amped guitars. These elements mix perfectly with stage piano-pads and a few digital effects. For “Ist Das Alles” as the closing tune on this nice EP, Endlos boost one single melody about more than eight minutes to something larger than life. Lofty, noisy, beautiful.Note: The original album “Kein Grund Zufrieden zu Sein” is available for free download at the band’s website.MP3 Postrock Music DownloadRelease-Site: Endlos - Kein Grund Zufrieden zu Sein (Live EP)Direct Download: Endlos - Kein Grund Zufrieden zu Sein (Live EP) ZIPNetlabel: www.1bit-wonder.comArtist Website: www.mypace.com/endlostoene",

Sutemos compiled no more than 28 high quality tracks which slide smoothly from one into the other while listening. “Intelligent Toys 4” awaits you with atmospheric electronic music filled with sweet melodies and sweeping synthesizers.Slowly taking off with an ambient and atmospheric track called “Dried Flowers, Mirrored World” produced by Sabi, our steward Walkman serves us continuously one embrassing tune after the other. Walkmans phenomenal choice of music convince us and we let loose while floating with the flow of his compilation. Take “Terra Det” from IJO for example. This track takes you on a flight on spheric synthesizer strings. Slightly shreddered and clickering beats combined with caring melodies build a wonderful scenery full of fluffy clouds.Along with the incredible quality of each track, I am truely surprised how the whole music sampler fits together. This is futuristic and yet optimistic music at its best. A great journey into sounds from ambient to ambient to clicks and cuts. Don’t miss this one!MP3 Electronica/IDM Music DownloadRelease: VA - Intelligent Toys 4 (Sutemos019)MP3-Download: Intelligent Toys 4 in a zip file (208 Mb)",

After a critically acclaimed album and an experimental EP at 12rec.net, Rap-duo Sichtbeton came back with a few new songs and features in 2006. A new album and an exclusive mixtape are planned for late 2007. To sweeten the idle time, MC Lunte &amp; Tillevision released a tiny concept EP: get to know about “Anabelle &amp; Karsten”!You’ve got three songs to become familiar with Anabelle and Karsten, one of these neurotic couples that look for interpersonal warmth but basically hate themselves. Lunte switches the perspective with every tune, starting with Karsten who meets “Anabelle”.Berlin producer Tillevision serves his pumping and melodic beats, DJ V-Raeter drops tight cuts. Musically, the track works rather like an energetic 70’s Soul tune than classic Hip Hop. The production is quite lo-fi, but the vibe is right; some kind of smooth out Madlib. Track two “Karsten” has a similar feel, Blaxploitation-horns and Lunte’s high-energy raps. Someone commented on his vocals as a mixture between the german actor Manfred Krug and Ghostface Killah… correct!Finally, “Anabelle &amp; Karsten” draws a bitter picture of the couple buying a house and moving to an intact neighbourhood though nothing has changed… Sie werden schon wissen warum.MP3 Hip Hop Music DownloadRelease-Site: Sichtbeton feat.

Their music is extremely dense and loud, very melodic and they draw a lot of inspiration from the 90’s shoegazing acts, namely My Bloody Valentine and Ride. To be listened at high volume!“All Our Actions are Constantly Repeated” is their debut at the London High Point Low Life-label. HPLL are a CD- and CDr-label but they just decided to deposit their whole back catalogue for free download at Last.fm, so you will be able to try the music and purchase the (very beautiful) CD at a low price later on. The production of the whole album is very well done so the loud passages do not drown in overload. You can carefully follow the textures that form beyond the wall of sound, at least most of the time.13-minutes monster “Constellation of Rings” is my favourite tune. I love these moments when the whole band melts to a single sound amalgam, when dynamic elements are fused to textures and new elements form psycho-acoustical beneath the music that is played. Here, shoegazing Postrock continues a Minimal Music-tradition listeners should know about when judging this kind of music.MP3 Postrock Music DownloadRelease: The Mandelbrot Set - “All Our Actions are Constantly Repeated”Artist Website: mandelbrotset.co.ukRead the full text article at RUBored.org![](http://mandelbrotset.co.uk/ “The Mandelbrot Set Website”)",

A gently played guitar and calm but slightly fuzzed accords form the backbone of his sound. Inbetween his compositions you always notice everyday sounds in the background.

After all, Off the Sky seems to be his main alias. The title of Corder’s third Autoplate installation “Cumulae Movement” refers to the formation of thunder clouds (cumulo nimbus) that can build impressive clusters, announcing rain and tempest.Influenced by field-recordings and weather pattern data (offthesky.com), Jason Corder injects his dense Ambient music with the unreal and slightly menacing atmosphere of a threatening thunderstorm. Highly processed field-recordings and all kinds of warm glitches form his music alongside huge harmonic synthesizer-textures, clean and amplified guitar, sketches of piano and a few subliminal beats.

The Bondi battery has a quite heavy Rock-sound, which captures the live-energy of the trio very well.Talking about Johann Bourquenez’s awesome play, I like to drop another name you should be familiar with: McCoy Tyner and 1962’s Cecil Taylor. Concerning the power of the trio in a whole, one can’t avoid naming Art Blakey for reference. Second tune “Mairie des Lilas” is nothing else but a damn revelation.

One of my best mixes so far is the “Ambient Architextures 2”-mix which I mixed in a relaxed mood with an ear for classic ambient. Since I released the mix on archive.org there has been plenty of reactions. Besides reactions from musiclovers over at Archive.org even people who believe in esoteric stuff enjoyed the mix. As an artist and producer it’s always interesting how and which people respond to your art.The selection is heavily influenced by music works such as albums like “Selected Ambient Works” from Aphex Twin or the amazing “G-Spot” album by Speedy J. The mix takes you on a pleasant and peaceful trip which lasts exactly 77:14 minutes. During this deep journey into melodic ambient-works produced by various artists, the mix drifts mainly on beatless tracks. Have a nice journey!Playlist01.

With the new EP by sound-designer miè, Digital Kunstrasen gain prove for the fact that ambient tunes may function in even less than ten minutes.      miè is Martin Seidel, a young fellow from the city of Leipzig in Eastern Germany. You might know him for his nice debut EP “Subjektive Perspektiven” or his appearance at the second “Electronica Unplugged”-sampler at Aerotone.“Day in, Day out” is his first work for Digital Kunstrasen. It’s made of five diverting little sketches of Ambient and low-energy IDM. “Mangle my Nightmare” comes up with some beautiful textures, both synthesized and sampled. Experimental yet tonal and harmonic. “Commen Behaviour” is subtle Electronica, introducing a more rhythmical corset for Martin’s soundscapes. For the final track “Meubl”, miè teamed up with French producer Pixe whose beats are a bit more crunchy. The songs on “Day in, Day out” are not longer than 4:30, getting to the point outright.

That’s how the first Colonius Monk Collective-sampler came to be. Two years later, Ideology is back with the second volume. Gringo Starr, Lunte, Slomo, Fleur Earth and all the others are still there to gain prove that German Hip Hop in 2007 does not necessarily has to be boring and cliché-laden.Cologne might be famous for Kraut Rock and the Cologne Cathedral, but very few people have heard of Rap and Soul music from the Rhine metropolis. That’s a shame. Gringo Starr of the Broke Gringos and Lunte of Berlin Rap-duo Sichtbeton are two of the most talented and innovative MCs around. Check “Flamenco” (with SB DJ V-Raeter on the beats) and the awesome posse track “Medikamente” for a taste of their skillfull and lyrical raps.LAH, Slomo and SEL are good MCs, though their style might be a bit more common, a bit more 90’s (which is nothing to be ashamed of after all). Try “Masterplan” with MC SEL and Reechad at the decks. Last but not least: the girl Fleur Earth. Once I wrote a review about her “Zirkular EP” at Ideology, and I liked these tunes better than the performance she shows up with on CMC II.

Catalogue number 108 is a four-track EP entitled Litter by Siblings (which is No Type coordinator David Turgeon and songstress Kaia Wong). What may “Pop songs about changing the cat litter and paying the rent” will sound like?First of all: they sound damn good! Their tracks fuse different elements: Pop- and House music, HipHop and IDM. The opener “Litter” is made from a simple House beat, pitched down to make your head nod. Alongside the oldschool claps and David’s funny proto-Rap, Kaia sings a simple melody with her beautiful and unpolished voice. “It’s Still Working” has a stronger leaning to Deep House and early 80’s No Wave, somewhere between Gomma and DFA Records. With “Rent and Taxes”, the Siblings come back to with a campy Hip Hop tune whose cut-up beats and string-arrangements make me think of the late Matthew Herbert. Very cool.

He is accomplished by Otto Totland of critically acclaimed Norwegian engineers of emotion Deaf Center.First track “Lodge” start with intimate piano chords. The microphone is placed very close to the strings, you can hear the dull beat of the hammers. In the end, the pianist holds his breath… The second track is entitled “Kyoto”. Indeed: the first thing that came to my mind was Japanese Folklore. A few piano tones at hand, the song comes off with some interesting and beautiful harmonies between Avant-Garde and Pop music. Same for “Marefjellet”. The sound of distant rain and these haunting string-arpeggios in the back make you think of Arvo Pärt and Moondog. My personal favourite is “Cad Goddeu”, though. An amorphous composition of slowly smoldering sound layers it is, with filtered strings, concentric loops of solemnly clarinet-tones and sketches of shady piano.

Thus, Sudermann’s guitar-chords play a key role if you want to describe Holzlaub.First track Viburnum Farreri comes along with huge delay. Sudermann’s loose chords trail away and leave the listener with an impression of vastness. Solid work, both artists session with a good amount of musicality and rhythmic understanding. But track two is far better: Córylus Avellána is a 13 minutes-groove monster that fuses ambient, Krautrock and protohouse (which is, funk). Wow! Thuja Plicata afterwards reminds me a lot of the folky moments at “Niun Niggung” by German electronica band Mouse on Mars. There is the same mood of good humoured resentment I really enjoy. The last track (Amelanchier Ovalis) carries along this mood and transfers it into a well-composed, fractalised Folk-song.

What about his new release at Alexandre Navarro’s EKO Netlabel?Taking his former albums in account, one might get the impression that the GoGooo-sound at “Nuages” has changed. Well, let’s say it moved. The opening track “Un Arbre” is a composition for delay and singing bowls. Clusters of complex sine waves stick in the back of the track, just like whirring air above the woods on a hot summer day. Looped and lost.Gabriel applies very decent electronic treatment to the main source, altering the dynamics of single events or adding shy noises here and there. Track number three is called “Petites Choses” and introduces a sweet guitar-motive. First time Gabriel closes ranks to his older, more musical works. Fusing more analytical elements with expanded field-recordings, “Dormir (Forêt)” at position four sounds exactly like this: asleep in the woods. Hypnotic!

            "content": "Benfay lives in Bern, Switzerland, and is one of the early netaudio-artists who released his music on the web. His first releases can be found on the highly proclaimed Thinner netlabel. While Benfay produced pushing and Detroit-inspired tracks in the beginning like Bonnie Mandarin (MP3) on his Carbon EP, he later composed more smooth and melodic tracks.But Benfay didn’t only produce music for Thinner, he even mastered as engineer some of the most popular Thinner-releases. Later on he opened his own netlabel together with Digitalis and Sam Graf. They called their now resting netlabel Realaudio. There you’ll find Benfays album “albedo feature”, where he focused on ambient and experimental sounds.One of my favorite Benfay-albums is his “One Touch Button Music LP”. On this album Benfay combines various musicstyles from ambient to electronica to dub-inspired techno-tracks. His ambient-track “Plötzliche Kühle” (MP3)Benfay Thinner Bio is definetely one of my all-time-netaudio favourites. Don’t miss the amazing remix of “Plötzliche Kühle “ by Lufth (MP3) on “One Touch Button Remixes LP”. Both ambient-works cool you down with mellow melodies and an individual cinematic vibe.The latest production from Benfay “Born On A Houseboat” sadly didn’t convince me very much. Only his shuffle-house-track “Phlegmatic Face” grabs you by the scruff of your neck and pushes you gently on the dancefloor.",

            "content": "Aural Tour-Diary // Direwires is Adam Young of Ontario, a recording artist and founder of Robotopera Netlabel (it’s a shame the label is on hiatus right now but their releases are accessible via archive.org). Anyway, Sleeping Near Highways is a collaboration-project from Young and label-buddy Freder who travelled Canada for a while and found themselves, well, sleeping near highways during this time. Their music is made of delayed synth-chords, expanded field-recordings and a lot of space between the tones. Some kind of aural tour-diary which reflects the eerie feeling of being away from home, bored and trapped somewhere alongside the road.Prelude to Sleep is a simple composition that’s mainly based on a filter-modulated synth sound. Very warm, very relaxing, though there’s some kind of bad premonition left- this sleep will bring you nightmares. Glowing Through Eyelids is the awaking afterwards. Like the song of a bird when the sun rises, morning rushes in with tender synthesizer-chirping. While this tune could have been released on Autoplate without a problem, most of the other songs on Sleeping Near Highways contain certain elements of experimental Rock music that make them more difficult to categorize. Innovative and hypnotizing.MP3 Electronica Music DownloadRelease: Direwires &amp; Freder - Sleeping Near Highways (Robotopera)Download: Direwires &amp; Freder - Sleeping Near Highways ZIP",

            "content": "Sunlit Electronica // Young Poland musician Tomasz Bednarczyk is best known for his “Milipop”-moniker. Due to the slightly more traditional electronica of Milipop, Tom started composing with a more experimental, yet emotional purpose. The four beautiful sound-sculptures for his So Nice **EP are nonpoint memories of a hot summer in the country, or, if you’re facing the artwork, at the seaside. You can’t remember the details, but the feeling lasts.Opening track So Nice is made from looped and layered acoustic guitars. Tomasz forces his samples to cough and stumble, introduces single chords and adds harmonic patterns. There’s a strong sense of melancholia in the composition but the track **never gets too florid or kitschy due to the loose sound-design. Snow at number two is quite similar, though Tom’s influences become a bit more evident. The straight loop makes you think of certain Krautrock-bands, another comparison might be the music of early Marsen Jules. Final composition Love is a dubby good-night farewell. With deadbeat Rhodes and delicate synthesizers, Tomasz Bednarczyk closes ranks to artists like Jan Jelinek or Pole. No big harmonies, still a pleasant last dance.MP3 Electronica Music DownloadRelease: Tomasz Bednarczyk - So Nice EP (AudioTong)Download from archive.org: Tomasz Bednarczyk - So Nice EP ZIP",

The producers, labelheads and activists of the ansiform netlabel remain in the dark. They hide in the anonymous space of the world wide web and enjoy producing subtle, gently and peaceful ambient music. So every release may be produced by a different composer… maybe not. But each one-track-release is individual, that’s for sure.The soundscapes of the unknown producers sometimes float smooth and peaceful, and sometimes they swoosh with all kinds of drones and noises. Even so some tracks tickle in your ears with some grain, the music stays innovative and somehow cineastic. There are no aggressive sounds for instance like in noise-music. Ambient music to lean back and start dreaming. All tracks of the Ansiform Collection sweep calmly and filled with emotion through the air. The collective describes their music precisely, when they say:  “ansiform is a collective of artists dedicated to creating subtle soundtracks for your most sedate endeavors. the ansiform style of ambient revolves around unobtrusive, highly-textured, beatless soundscapes - aural wallpaper to complement any calm environment.”MP3 Ambient Music DownloadNetlabel-Website: ansiform.afraid.orgWhole collection on Archive.org: www.archive.org/details/ansiform",

While they happily distribute their new sounds via Kompakt, they spoil us with floating liveacts.So nowadays Kollektiv Turmstrasse amaze the Techno-Underground with one fabulous liveact after another. Their style could be described as floating and kicking techno with some nostalgic looks backwards when trance was still underground and sweeping melodies a reason to let it go.
